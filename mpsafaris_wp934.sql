I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt. My friends, there are links in the show notes to some of the groups that Matt referenced. And that is it for this special edition of the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Be safe, be kind to yourself and others, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"The Month in WordPress – February 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/the-month-in-wordpress-february-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 17:40:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"the month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12411\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:332:\"There’s a lot going on in the world right now, and safety is top of mind for everyone in the WordPress community.

This month we feature a website developer and engineer from the US, who found the software and its community provide the impetus to keep her going forward.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gave Tonya Mork a new lease of energy after a health crisis from which she nearly died. She had spent two decades as an electrical and software engineer in high tech automated manufacturing. But when she discovered the WordPress software, teaching it to others became her new purpose. Through this discovery, she has gone on to help thousands of developers understand and build code in great depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her WordPress journey, she has shared her skills in the roles of Release Coordinator and the Core Tech Editor for the most recent major WordPress release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/\">5.9</a> Joséphine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/featured-img-tonyamork.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured in her work room\" class=\"wp-image-12326\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/featured-img-tonyamork.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/featured-img-tonyamork.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/featured-img-tonyamork.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/featured-img-tonyamork.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"life-takes-an-unexpected-turn\">Life takes an unexpected turn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first 22 years of Tonya’s life, she rose through the ranks from enlisted personnel in the US Navy to a highly sought after chief engineer with a multi million-dollar industrial automation engineering firm.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while she was working in engineering, her life was to change dramatically. In 2007, Tonya started to face health challenges that had an impact on all that she had known.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I did not recognize myself.</strong></p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, she woke up at home ready to visit a client’s facility where her firm was building a robotic system. She said: “As I headed for the door, I fell to my knees, as this wave of pain crushed down on my chest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors diagnosed her with a very rare heart disease that caused her blood vessels to spasm, cutting off blood to whatever was downstream of the blockage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, she was diagnosed with a second rare and more serious condition, related to the migraines from which she had been suffering. Combined with her heart condition, this made every migraine attack life-threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly seven years, the unexpected changes to her health left her mostly homebound and constantly monitored. This meant she had to close her engineering firm and say goodbye to staff and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I was lost. I didn’t recognize myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in her darkest hour, she found her strength. Tonya made a choice to move forward, and make the most of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you are at rock bottom, you have to make a decision or else it will consume you. My decision was that I chose to be happy,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Tonya’s first steps was to start writing a blog using WordPress. In this she shared insights on how to find peace and joy in any situation. She wrote about kindness and helping one another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of making solutions through WordPress became a way for Tonya to accept her new life and not feel as limited by her health. She wanted purpose, and in WordPress, she found just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya felt she could do something worthwhile in the virtual world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-ray-of-hope-for-tonya\">A ray of hope for Tonya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Tonya’s health deteriorated further. She was admitted into intensive care and was diagnosed with a third rare disease, this time related to her autoimmunity. She was not expected to survive this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following what she describes as a ‘miraculous recovery,’ she became stronger and was able to stop relying on a wheelchair. She used the energy from working on websites to keep going. “WordPress kept my mind alive,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had first used WordPress for her engineering firm’s intranet. But when she discovered the software’s full potential and the collaborative opportunities of open source, it opened a new world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again&#8221;</p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years which followed, she donated her time to build some WordPress websites and plugins. She said: “Through giving my time, I was able to do something other than sit in isolation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya was amazed by the sharing in open source in general and in WordPress in particular. She said: “I was amazed to see people sharing so much information freely with one another. In my former engineering world, information was proprietary. Throughout my career, I had worked to break down those silos and help anyone to understand complex systems. I was drawn to this open community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also became aware that WordPress developers were hungry to learn more about development. She wanted to be part of the solution with her passion for teaching and the knowledge she had gained in industry.<br><br>She said: “Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again. Here in this community, I was able to feel like a person again, not a sick one, but a professional with something to give.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest in the software grew, Tonya decided to start a non-profit where she turned to WordPress to build the websites. This re-sparked her interest in programming. She said: “I wanted to really know the code and understand what made it tick.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realization led Tonya to start the WP Developers’ Club, which in turn spawned <a href=\"https://knowthecode.io/\">Know the Code</a>, to help educate individual developers, and is still used today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-helping-wordpress-companies-to-working-on-wordpress-core\">From helping WordPress companies to working on WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured with her dog\" class=\"wp-image-12328\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya went on to work with big and medium size WordPress companies helping their developers and supporting them in raising their firms’ leverage with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2020, she knew she wanted to do even more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Tonya joined an international firm in the ecosystem and began working closely on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, WordPress Core was pulling together a new Triage team. Tonya started volunteering on that team to find collaborative solutions, and help others do so. In 2020 for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">WordPress 5.6 Simone</a>, she became the release’s Triage lead, and again for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-7/\">WordPress 5.7 Esperanza</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, she became a Test Team Rep and helped to expand the team and is an advocate for the value of testing and feedback in the release development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-successful-chapter-with-wordpress-5-9\">A new, successful chapter with WordPress 5.9</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya was one of the notable contributors to the WordPress 5.9 release featured in this picture.\" class=\"wp-image-12329\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1536%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=2048%2C959&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya’s passion for the software and getting people involved in its growth continued. For the WordPress 5.9 release in 2021, she took on the role of both the Core Tech Lead and the Release Coordinator. As this was a big release and included the first major implementation of Full Site Editing, it had many moving parts and hundreds of contributors. She was able to share the skills she had learned in communication and project management from her days streamlining and documenting engineering software and processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 24 hours of WordPress 5.9 landing, it had more than 10 million downloads—and 17 formally reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-back-to-open-source\">Giving back to open source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in what Tonya describes as her third chapter. She said: “I’m a very different person from the engineer I used to know.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy &#8211; here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a non-mailbag mailbag question that I would like to answer for y&#8217;all today. Non-mailbag because no one actually emailed me about it and mailbag because Twitter is basically like a giant mailbag. And I do get a lot of DMS about this particular topic. If you want to send something to my actual WP Briefing mailbag, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@worpress.org\">wpbriefing@worpress.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question that I frequently get asked in my DMS on Twitter is: what is Five for the Future? It&#8217;s not always that tidy the question, but that still is the question we&#8217;re answering today. So if you take a casual survey of active contributors to the WordPress project, the high-level answer that you&#8217;re likely to get to that question is “a way to remind people to give back to the project.” Or, if you run in more business-y circles, you might hear that it is an initiative that encourages companies to give back 5% of their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of those answers are true. So a quick mini-history lesson; the original concept of Five for the Future came from Matt Mullenweg in 2014. There&#8217;s a lovely blog post on it that I will link in the notes below, but it was essentially a call to any companies experiencing success with WordPress to contribute back to the project and make sure that the project was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial program then included outreach recognition, et cetera, proposed in 2017 by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/liljimmi/\">Tracy Levesque</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a>. Then that was defined and formalized with the help of the WordPress community in 2018. And then, in 2019, we had our first trial run with entire dedicated teams sponsored by companies inside the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the mini-history lesson chronology of this program. The intentions that informed the work of building the program in 2017 have become a bit lost to the ages. So I&#8217;m here to share it with you. The basic heart and soul of the Five for the Future program is to make sure that there is a way to refresh the commons of the WordPress community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a result, ensure that the common resources of WordPress are available long after we have stopped being available to care for them. If you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, Five for the Future was created to help avoid that tragedy. There were two original goals for formalizing the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one was to acknowledge companies that participated in Five for the Future by sponsoring contributors to work on the WordPress project. And the second was to motivate more companies to sponsor more volunteers. Either by hiring them and paying them to contribute or by assigning their existing employees to contribute to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to quantify participation and hard to qualify what should be seen as an impactful contribution, which is why when the program was originally created, it was in partnership with team reps and community members who were active at the time. There are many posts around that discuss the next steps for this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;m looking through them, the next steps revolve around some of the hardest and most important questions that we have to answer as a project and as stewards of open source. Those questions are things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> How do we remain true to these gloriously subversive values of WordPress and open source while also finding a way to thoughtfully secure our organization&#8217;s future?</li><li>Does contributing without the expectation of reciprocity hold up when we are looking at how to acknowledge contributors who sustain us?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re familiar with Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s award-winning work, Governing the Commons, you may also be wondering how this particular program aligns with her eight principles designed to sustain organizations like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:57]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside to that last question, this particular program does not have all eight principles accounted for, but among WordPress&#8217;s many programs, we do account for most of them. Although imperfectly, as is the way with human beings, that&#8217;s probably a whole episode unto itself, I did want to quickly answer that particular question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get back to my non-mailbag, mailbag question, if I had to tell you in the span of an elevator ride what Five for the Future was, this would be my answer. <strong>It is a v1 program with a dual goal of boldly declaring the need to refresh the shared resources of WordPress and offering the ways and means for communities and individuals alike to participate in refreshing those resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out wordpress.org/5. Like literally just the number five. Or, if you want to learn more about the program that has grown from the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out the white paper that&#8217;s linked in the notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Number one on my small list, the planning post for WordPress 6.0 is out. I&#8217;ve included a link in my massive list of links below. But it includes our best guess at timing, features that we intend to include, and a call for volunteers as well. So if you are looking for ways to give back, that is a clear and immediate option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is if you are a team rep, don&#8217;t forget that we have daylight saving time ending and starting depending on your hemisphere within the month. If you move meetings, if you&#8217;re in a team that moves your meetings, discuss it now so that folks have time to adjust their calendars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on my small list of big things is that there&#8217;s a suite of Full Site Editing courses that are now available on learn.wordpress.org. I will add that to my giant list of links below, but I encourage you to wander on over and see what all the fuss is about. I think the courses are excellent. They&#8217;re great for folks who don&#8217;t quite know what Full Site Editing is yet, but then also they give you a few intermediate tips and tricks as you&#8217;re getting your legs underneath you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:27]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12288\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"A New WordPress News\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/02/a-new-wordpress-news/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 17:56:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Meta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12244\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:385:\"In June 2021, @beafialho in collaboration with @pablohoney floated the idea of giving WordPress News a new look.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I published a post about the big picture goals for the WordPress project in 2022. As I was thinking through our planned releases for the year and looking out toward what would spell success for WordPress over the next three years, three things really lined up in both sets of answers for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I provided some detail on how we can work toward these goals in the post, which I will link for you in the show notes, but I also wanted to take some time to explain why I feel we have to work toward these goals this year. So these all build on one another. To refresh your memory of the three big focuses, they are one to drive adoption of the new editor in WordPress, support open source alternatives for site building necessities, and three, open source stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one; is driving the adoption of the new WordPress editor. Early on in the start of the Gutenberg Project, folks could not go two days without hearing me talk about the phases of adoption and how those line up with the phases of Gutenberg, and who would need our support the most in each of those phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always believed that what we would be shipping at this point in our project would prove the plausible promise of what we were doing in phase one. That&#8217;s definitely what I&#8217;m seeing from what was shipped in 5.9, as well as what we plan to ship in May with 6.0. And the people who need the most support right now are absolutely our users, your clients, no matter whether they were not keeping up with WordPress developments or simply were waiting to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be people who look to you as someone who has been here a while to help them make sense of what they&#8217;re seeing. And what I find so exciting about this adoption, sort of, work in the WordPress project is that this is the time when we as practitioners of WordPress, no matter whether you are a designer or a developer or builder, business coach. This is the time when we get to guide others through the hardest parts of our learning processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of helping people to learn new technologies relies not only on your hard-won expertise but also on the belief that the future is worth fighting for. Enabling someone’s success is an investment in the future and investment for that person or for WordPress or your community. All investments are welcome here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, table stakes are just that you care. And speaking of future investments, the second focus is open source alternatives for site building necessities. So things like images, forms, stores, themes, etc. It literally just things you need to build a site. I would like to start by saying that I am completely aware of the fact that 99% of WordPress users will never care about open source freedoms and philosophies in the same way that WordPress maintainers and contributors care about open source freedoms and philosophies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could substitute the name of any other open source project right there, and the statement would still be true. And yet, I will always believe that people should have the rights and freedoms that open source brings to them even if they do not know they are there. And so it makes all the sense in the world to me that as a project and open source community, we should strive to make choosing Open Source as easy as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, open source stewardship is one of the focuses for this year. This one is obviously about supporting open source as a concept and maintaining WordPress as a project. But I also think that it is relevant to our current global circumstances. Open Source suddenly became very visible to the public eye last year following the Log4J vulnerability, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been hearing consistent concern over how We make sure that WordPress is sustainable moving into the future. Fortunately, this is a topic that&#8217;s near and dear to my heart. And I have been delighted to see so many community members bringing that conversation to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot that is done in the WordPress project to keep us from the tragedy of the commons. But that work honestly never ends. Not only does it not end, but as we get bigger, there is more and more that we can and should be doing to keep us around for the long term. And, of course, for the keen readers of my posts, there&#8217;s a bonus focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus focus is, of course, that WordPress turns 20 years old next year. This year, we will also be seeing some preparatory work for that major milestone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us today to our small list of big things. There is a redesign of the News Page coming. We&#8217;ve been talking about this over on make.wordpress.org/design for a bit since like June of last year or something. But it&#8217;s coming in the next few weeks. I&#8217;ll share a link to the GitHub repo in case anyone has any specific things that they see as they are reading through all of our many news stories that come out on that particular page. I think it&#8217;s beautiful, and I&#8217;m very excited to take a look at it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that planning is underway for WordPress 6.0; that release that we&#8217;re doing in May. I&#8217;ll add the project page link to the show notes. I&#8217;ve had a few raised hands for that release squad. But if you&#8217;re interested in participating in the release, I encourage you to keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for updates and any news about how to get involved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my third thing is actually that, in general, there are a lot of opportunities to contribute right now. There are discussions about projects, goals, and dreams happening all over the place. I&#8217;ll link in the show notes below the unofficial project “firehose” where you can see all the headlines and quickly find discussions that might be interesting to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12176\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"The Month in WordPress – January 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/02/the-month-in-wordpress-january-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Feb 2022 19:41:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12180\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:335:\"There are a few significant moments in the history of the WordPress project.

This is more than just a new default theme. It’s a brand-new way to work with WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/\">Block themes</a> put a wide array of visual choices directly in your hands, from color schemes and font combinations to page templates and image filters, all from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor/\">Site Editor</a>. So in one place, you can give Twenty Twenty-Two the same look and feel as your organization’s other materials—or take your site’s look in another direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already have the Twenty Twenty-Two theme—it came installed with WordPress 5.9. You will find it with your other installed themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12102\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"your-personal-paintbox-awaits\">Your personal paintbox awaits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two is not the only theme built for full site editing. More block themes are in the Themes directory, and the number will grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use any of those new themes, you no longer need the Customizer. Instead, you have all the power of the Styles interface inside the Site Editor. Just as in Twenty Twenty-Two, you build your site’s look and feel there, with the tools you need for the job in a fluid interface that practically comes alive in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-navigation-block\">The Navigation block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks come to site navigation, the heart of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Navigation block gives you the power to choose: an always-on responsive menu or one that adapts to your user’s screen size.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday marked three years since the WordPress project welcomed me as their executive director. As I start my fourth year, I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time considering what the next five years will bring us. WordPress will turn 19 this year, which means that we will soon be a whopping 20 years old; for some of the people who have been with the project since the beginning, that can represent two-thirds of their whole life. And even if you were not that young when you got here, two decades as an open source project is really a cause for celebration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not in that group that has been here forever. I showed up for the first time in 2009, as a community organizer, self-sponsored, and I learned so much about myself as a person and as a leader while I was doing that. So when I arrived as a sponsored contributor in 2015, I already knew exactly what made this work so fulfilling for me was these three things:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ability to lend a hand in those moments where I wish someone had lent a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the delight of seeing people&#8217;s first successes and the joy of watching them grow over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third was a chance to be part of something great, which turned out to be something greater; greater than me or you or a CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is still at the heart of what I feel I get out of the WordPress project. But it has also grown substantially in my seven years as a sponsored contributor. I now also love how we as a community of contributors get to foster a better way to lead and a better way to collaborate. And through those things help people find a way to have a better life. Not just through WordPress, the CMS, but through WordPress, the people, and WordPress, the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when I think of what I want for WordPress in its 19th year, so that we can head with confidence and dignity into our 20th year, it is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to remember that you are not alone here. People come together in the world often because of a shared location. But WordPress fosters this beautiful experience of bringing us together because of what we care about. Whether you care about PHP standards, diversity in technology, helping people with their first big wins, making WordPress more secure. I mean, if what you care about is being able to write the most arcane and complex apps on top of WordPress that the world has ever seen. Then there are others out there who want to do that with you, too. We have so many things to connect about. And fortunately, we support a great piece of software for getting our thoughts out in the world. Take some time to see who else shares your thoughts and potentially learn a bit about the view from the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of the other side, I also want us to approach our discussions as the US versus the Problem TM. WordPress may be 20 years old, and we may stand on the shoulders of giants, but right now, the people who are here you, you are explorers and creators and guides toward the best possible future for WordPress. The tension that we witness between teams is always about the best possible answers for the people who use our software. It is about securing the freedoms of the open web for everyone who comes after us whether they know they need those freedoms or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I want us to expand our reasons for doing this at all. If you are a member of the community of contributors, We frequently talk about how we give back because WordPress gave to us. Or if you are part of a Five for the Future group. You have heard that companies who have experienced success because of WordPress should commit 5% of their resources back to the project to ensure WordPress&#8217; long-term success. But the reason that I keep doing this, and hopefully a new reason for you to keep doing this is that we can take part in securing opportunities for future users of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I want WordPress to be the best CMS. Yes, I want this community to be vibrant and engaged. Yes, I want WordPress to be a shining beacon of how to work remotely. And I want all of that because I know it is our careful and tireless stewardship of this project that lets us continue to lend a hand in those moments where people wish for someone to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my hopes for WordPress in 2022 to move us forward into WordPress of the future. I hope you all will come with me and we can continue our journey together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for listening. I&#8217;m Josepha Haden and this is the WP Briefing. See you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12043\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"WordPress 5.9 RC 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/wordpress-5-9-rc-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:43:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"RC2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"The second Release Candidate (RC2) for WordPress 5.9 is available!

His fascination with development and learning continued to grow, and he now makes a living using WordPress and the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to discover his story, which shows with creativity and determination you can create products and make a living using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"starting-web-building-on-a-phone\"><strong>Starting web building on a phone</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=350%2C426&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Collins Agbonghama headshot photo\" class=\"wp-image-11920\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/12/collins-agbonghama1.jpg?resize=246%2C300&amp;ssl=1 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins began his exploration of the internet while attending Secondary School in Nigeria, or High School as it is known in some other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend at the school had a simple mobile phone which could browse the internet. Collins had his first introduction to the World Wide Web through access to this device. He became hooked by reading headlines on a sports site about a famous English Premier League Football Club, Chelsea, a soccer team which he has long supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Being a very inquisitive person, I wanted to learn how the web works as well as have my own website. I was able to buy a classic mobile phone through the menial jobs I did after school,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first website was a wapsite or Wireless Application Protocol site optimized for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He took to Google to learn how to actually build a site. He discovered he needed something called an ‘email address’ to sign-up for site builders. Google Search came to the rescue again, and he created the first email account for his first website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A desire for a website was the catalyst for further learning, starting with HTML and CSS from an online provider. His interest in building sites with more advanced tools grew, and then he came across WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using his savings, he bought the cheapest hosting plan from a local Nigerian web host. He installed WordPress and started writing tutorials for a mobile device platform. He built the site, created the lessons, and started his entry into WordPress all on a mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led to him having the confidence to start building sites for others, and he was able to earn a small income from that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I couldn’t go to the university because of my precarious financial situation. I continued to do menial jobs during the day and started learning PHP in the evenings and at night using my mobile phone via online learning platforms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was later able to get an old laptop, which helped him access ebooks to learn more and practice his coding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen to share this learning, he started blogging about what he was learning on his website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins said: “I later took up a job teaching children at a school primarily because I got tired of the menial jobs and wanted to earn enough to take care of my internet data plan. After a while, I became fairly proficient in PHP and even took up a job to build a school management system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"using-wordpress-to-make-a-living\"><strong>Using WordPress to make a living</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins’ blog wasn’t making money through advertisements, but he discovered opportunities to write tutorials for other platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I started writing PHP and WordPress development tutorials and got paid a few hundred dollars per article. In Nigeria, that’s quite a lot of money. I was able to improve the life and wellbeing of my family and myself,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting into a higher education program to study computer science, his life dramatically changed. He decided to stop writing and began to focus on building and selling WordPress plugins.&nbsp;His first one was a user and profile plugin for WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thankfully, after a year, it started making enough revenue for me to live pretty comfortably here in Nigeria because the cost of living here is relatively low,” he said</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Collins has several plugins which have given him a sustainable source of income. He’s also a Core and Translation volunteer contributor to the WordPress.org Open Source project. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I am thankful for WordPress because without it, I’m really not sure I would have been able to live a decent quality life. <br>Who knows what would have become of me?</p><cite>Collins Agbonghama</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am also thankful for the community. I have made lots of friends that have been very supportive and helpful in my journey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I tell people, life won’t give you what you want. You demand from life what you want. You make these demands by being determined and never giving up on your dreams and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you are poor, perhaps because you came from a humble and poor background, it is not your fault.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, ages and ages ago, when I first started this podcast, someone basically requested that Matt and I do a duet for the last podcast of the year. A Christmas carol duet; him on the saxophone and me on voice. I obviously did not get that coordinated I don&#8217;t even know why I said obviously. I&#8217;ll tell you right now I did not get that coordinated. I was a very busy lady this year. So I don&#8217;t have a Matt on saxophone. Still, I did think that maybe it might be nice just for me to sing a teensy little Christmas carol for you all just because it seems especially poignant the words this year, especially after the 2020, 2021 COVID, all the things and trying to get back in person. So I&#8217;m going to sing you all one little verse from <em>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>01:35 <em>Singing</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your heart be light</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be out of sight</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make the Yuletide gay</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now on our troubles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will be miles away</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are as in olden days</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy golden days of yore</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faithful friends who are dear to us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gather near to us, once more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years we all will be together</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fates allow</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang a shining star upon the highest bough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have yourself a merry little Christmas now</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, my friends, that was from my heart to yours if you happened to listen. If you skipped a few seconds to get through it, which I would totally understand, that is also fine. But I did want to just kind of wrap up the year to let you all know that I am so incredibly grateful for all of the people who show up for the WordPress project to make it a success. I have made so many friends and wonderful acquaintances throughout my time here with the WordPress project. And especially in my three years as the project&#8217;s Executive Director. You all have put a lot of trust in me and a lot of faith. And I know that we have gotten so much done together in the last few years. And I am equally sure that we&#8217;re going to get so much done in the years to come. And so thank you all so much for your continued work with WordPress and the way that you just bring your best at all times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other little thanks I want to give. Over the course of this year, I&#8217;ve had an excellent team that works with me on this podcast. I have editing and design folks and people who&#8217;ve joined me here and there, folks who helped me with my production. So big thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dustinhartzler/\">Dustin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beafialho/\">Bea</a>, I realize your name is Beatriz in the actual credits, but I call you Bea, and so thank you. Also, a huge thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">Chloé</a>, who does all of our production and wrangling every couple of weeks. A big round of applause and kudos to that tiny but tough team that helps me get this all done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s to go on top of the general thanks to the WordPress project. And if you all are celebrators, I hope you have a wonderful holiday season.

The hybrid event took place in New York City with a small audience (proof of vaccination required). As Matt said, &#8220;we had people join by plane, train, and automobile.&#8221; Those who didn’t make the trek to the live event watched the livestream from wherever they call home, all around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an exciting moment for the WordPress community which also celebrated its first in-person WordCamp in Sevilla, Spain, after a lengthy hiatus for in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">view the full recording</a>, complete with captions and transcripts on WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was thrilling to see so many meetup organizers host watch parties worldwide. Twenty-eight watch parties were held across eleven countries, with more than 300 RSVPs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to past State of the Word events, Matt covered a broad range of topics. This year was no different. WordPress’ past, present, and future were in the spotlight, with highlights on the growth of the contributors, language translations, recent release milestones, and educational initiatives, to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audience members and livestreamers alike viewed product demos showcasing upcoming features that will be the hallmark of WordPress 5.9, such as full site editing, block patterns, global styling options, and enhanced image controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt took the opportunity to remind everyone of the WordPress roadmap which includes native multi-lingual support and real-time collaborative site editing. He also pointed out that anyone can contribute to WordPress’ progress through a number of different initiatives ranging from creating new features and testing to helping spread the word and educate others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt emphasized the way that open source software gets better by reminding everyone that “The more people that use a program like WordPress, the better it gets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broader topics covering the tech landscape including web3, merger and acquisition activity, as well as the growth and support of open source software, rounded out the energetic presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-hour multimedia presentation was followed by an interactive <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2021-qa/\">question and answer</a> session where Matt fielded questions that were submitted ahead of the event, as well as questions from the livestream and studio audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discover everything that was covered by <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2021/12/15/matt-mullenweg-2021-state-of-the-word/\">watching the official event recording</a> and join the ongoing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ILoveWP\">#ILoveWP conversation on Twitter</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>dansoschin</a> for review and edits! </em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 5.9 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/12/wordpress-5-9-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 20:19:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11835\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WordPress 5.9 Beta 3 is now available for testing.

Read on for some highlights.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"full-site-editing\"><strong><strong>Full Site Editing</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"styles-interface\">The <strong>Styles Interface</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine all the features that went live in 5.8 with those making their entrance in 5.9, and you get <strong>Full Site Editing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formerly known as Global Styles, the Styles Interface lets you interact directly with your blocks and elements right in the WordPress Admin. From typography to color palettes, this cohesive design interface means a design change—even a dramatic one—can happen without a theme switch. <strong>No code needed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"theme-json\"><strong>Theme.json</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in WordPress 5.8, theme.json has been improved to enable features and default styles for your site and its blocks. With 5.9, theme.json can support child themes and the duotone treatment. Coordinate layers of style with theme.json, taking the weight off of your theme’s required CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features supported by theme.json include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Border:</strong> color, style, and width augment the border-radius property that landed in 5.8.</li><li><strong>Flex layouts:</strong> Block Gap support, courtesy of spacing.blockGap.</li><li><strong>Typography:</strong> font families, font style, font weight, text decoration, and text transform.</li><li><strong>Images</strong>: Duotones.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-new-navigation-block\"><strong>A New Navigation Block</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the most intuitive way to build navigation: the Navigation Block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the features that need testing the most:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Responsive menu options you can turn off, have always on, or opt to use only for small screens.</li><li>Built-in keyboard accessibility.&nbsp; For accessibility, for speed, or both.</li><li>Add extra blocks like Search and Site Icon blocks (and customize them to your liking).</li><li>Submenu items with styling options.</li><li>Horizontal or vertical alignment.</li><li>Reusable navigation? Even across themes? Yes. Because the Navigation Block you build gets saved as a custom post type.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-better-gallery-block\"><strong>A Better Gallery Block</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could treat single images in your Gallery Block the same way you treat the Image Block? <strong>Now you can.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Make every image in your gallery different from the next, with inline cropping or a duotone and change layouts with the ease of drag and drop. With the improved gallery block, every image is its own Image block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One thing to note: </strong>Have you built a plugin or theme on the Gallery Block functionality?<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/20/gallery-block-refactor-dev-note/\"> Be sure to review this Dev Note, which details what you need to do for compatibility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"focused-template-part-mode\"><strong>Focused Template Part Mode</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building template parts can take a level of focus all its own because you’re making decisions for the entire site. So WordPress 5.9 adds a focus mode that shows you only the part you’re working on right now (and you can get back to the regular view with a keystroke).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"block-pattern-directory\"><strong>Block Pattern Directory</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Pattern Directory</a> offers a range of prebuilt block patterns, from a couple of blocks that show an image and text, to an entire page layout with columns and sections. Since the 5.8 release, the directory has become a hub for exploratory UI and patterns, taking submissions and offering them to the community. So now, your creation can help other people build out their perfect site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"twenty-twenty-two-default-theme\"><strong>Twenty Twenty-Two Default Theme</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A whole new way of building WordPress themes.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.9 introduces features that make Full Site Editing possible, including <strong>the first default block theme</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using minimal CSS, theme styles reside in theme.json so that you can configure them in the Styles interface of the WordPress Admin. Make this theme take on its own personality site-wide, with a wide array of color schemes, type combinations, page templates, premade components (forms), and image treatments to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more-improvements-and-updates\"><strong>More Improvements and Updates</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you love to blog? New tweaks to the publishing flow let you add new posts just seconds after hitting Publish on your latest post.</li><li>List View lets you drag and drop content as easily as you could always cruise through it – and collapse entire sections – so you can concentrate on a task or get the bigger picture.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33955\">The Buttons and Social icons blocks now absorb</a> and display their parent block’s toolbar controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43700\">Choose your language</a> on the login screen.</li><li>More <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33868\">performance improvements</a> (i.e., speed).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Props to <a

Every event she attends is a further step on a journey of discovering the WordPress community and its many opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“It is not that hard to fall for WordPress if you have a chance to experience WordPress. For me, it took a WordCamp.”</p><cite>Devin Maeztri</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin&#8217;s first experience with camps came when she volunteered impromptu at an Indonesian event, WordCamp Denpasar, Bali in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, she made a profound discovery: “WordCamps can bring people who will give back to the community, even if they don’t get anything from WordPress directly.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With every WordCamp after that first experience, she became more interested in WordPress and the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, Devin found she wanted to be part of WordPress events more often. She became a regular at Meetups in Ubud and Jakarta, joining as a co-organizer at WordCamp Jakarta in 2017 and 2019. Later, she took on the role of co-organizer for Meetups in Jakarta and Ubud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smitten by what WordCamps can offer and how they can bring people together across national borders, she joined the organizing team for WordCamp Asia 2020. Sadly, this event was to become the first major WordPress event to be cancelled in the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, Devin hopes WordCamp Asia will happen someday very soon. Beyond the expected WordPress learning and sharing that event will promote, she believes its very scale will showcase how WordCamps add international tourism and cultural understanding everywhere they take place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Devin pictured with other WordCamp Asia organizers who attended WordCamp Europe in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-11692\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/wcasia_2020_organizers_in_wceu_2019.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>WordCamp Asia 2020 Organizers at WordCamp Europe 2019.

Photo Credit: Abha Thakor</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"showing-how-wordpress-can-be-used-locally\">Showing how WordPress can be used locally</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After experiencing several events, Devin had questions: “At WordCamps and Meetups, you hear stories about how WordPress powers the web. How it changes the lives of so many people, how it helps dreams come true. It made me think, considering WordPress is that powerful, why are there not even more people in Indonesia using websites, and more using WordPress? Why aren’t more talented Indonesian WordPress users, developers, designers, and business owners taking part in WordPress.org projects? Language, for me, was the main answer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution Devin felt was to make WordPress available in the main local language. She said: “I believe, the more content translated into Indonesian, the more Indonesian WordPress users see WordPress as more than just a blogging platform or a content management system. They will realize it’s a huge open source community that works together to make the web a better place. The more plugins and themes translated, the easier the work of the developer and designer will be. The more people see how WordPress can enhance their life, the better the ecosystem for business owners becomes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"encouraging-others-to-translate-wordpress\">Encouraging others to translate WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After talking with others about how WordPress could be even more useful in Indonesia, Devin felt she had to make a personal commitment to reviving the polyglot project in Indonesia. With another volunteer contributor and through promotion, the local polyglot team got bigger and the interest in translation grew. She also took on the responsibility of a General Translation Editor for the language.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Polyglot nominatee - Devin Maeztri\" class=\"wp-image-11706\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/featured-img-used-for-devin-pow2.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the efforts of Devin and the other translation editors, Indonesia took part in <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> in 2020, and in 2021 held sprints and learning sessions spanning the whole 30 days of the event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her enthusiasm and dedication to helping others translate WordPress locally and promoting the global community were recognized in the Polyglot Appreciation Nominations for 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"helping-to-give-access-to-more-diverse-audiences\">Helping to give access to more diverse audiences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Through her involvement in translation, Devin noticed there were not many women involved in the WordPress community in Indonesia. Often, she found herself the only woman at an event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, along with a couple of community members, she started Perempuan WordPress, a local initiative. This group is open for everyone to join, but prioritizes women as event speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin has gone on to support the work of the Diversity Speaker Training group in the Community Team, translating materials and promoting initiatives in Indonesia.&nbsp;She is keen to encourage others to get involved with this initiative which helps increase the diversity of presenters at Meetups and WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/devin-at-wc-jakarta2019.png?resize=600%2C534&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11689\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/devin-at-wc-jakarta2019.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/devin-at-wc-jakarta2019.png?resize=300%2C267&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Organizing at WordCamp Jakarta 2019</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In her professional roles, Devin is an advocate for WordPress as a tool for people with a wide variety of skill sets. She does not code, but uses the platform extensively for her projects. In 2014, she signed up for a free account on WordPress.com to keep and share notes about what she saw or was thinking about as she commuted on public transport to work. This site did not turn into a blog, but instead introduced her to other opportunities and the vast capabilities of the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-can-support-your-skills-and-passions\">WordPress can support your skills and passions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a background in environmental activism, Devin has worked for international development organizations on everything from policymaking to campaigning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the desk, she worked with policymakers and organized conferences and meetings. That meant doing a lot of writing and translating and working with people on the ground who were impacted by the policies. “My work on the ground usually involved researching, movement building and community empowerment,” she noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her work with events inspired Devin to get involved in WordCamps and Meetups and share her energy for making things happen. As in her professional work, she felt WordPress was an opportunity to work and share with people about something that can make a positive impact on someone else’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For me, everything comes from the heart. I do things that I feel so strongly about. Things that call me, and things that I am good at but still giving me room to learn and become better at. WordPress can be the perfect place for this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she was between jobs, Devin was encouraged to volunteer at WordCamp Denpasar 2016. With some help, she created an online CV. She also learned to manage a WordPress site, navigate the wp-admin, and make the content appeal to potential employers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She eventually got a job as a campaigner to build a movement online and offline. The brainchild of many university friends in America, who used digital campaigns to go global, the campaign used WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin worked alongside a digital campaigner and helped shape the content, the call to action, and the user experience. She also had to use the wp-admin to make some amendments. As a global movement, it developed its resources in English, so she also reviewed the work of the translators she worked with.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"One of Devin\'s cats watches the WPTranslationDay 2021 livestreamed events.\" class=\"wp-image-11688\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/cat-watching-translation-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Devin&#8217;s cat became a regular on social media posts about #WPTranslationDay 2021</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>She left her job as a campaigner at the end of 2018 to concentrate on freelancing – and to spend more of her free time contributing to the WordPress community. She also took up the initiative to help street cats in Jakarta.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin said: “So, I am busy helping these cats but also learning how to fundraise using a website. I’m learning to use online forms, set up a payment service provider, work on SEO, and do other new things I need to learn to grow my initiative. I do have the privilege to learn directly from a personal guru. The same person who convinced me to volunteer at WordCamp Denpasar, and who I married in 2018.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-gives-everyone-a-chance-to-learn\">WordPress gives everyone a chance to learn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin was so enthused by being a contributor for WordPress, she took part in the video shorts following the Translation Day events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsiQzdmAz8g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Devin talks about translating in this short <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsiQzdmAz8g\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> (opens in a new tab on YouTube)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>She is also active in other Contributor Teams and decided to become a Community Team Deputy to support meetups in new cities across Indonesia and perhaps future WordCamps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “One of the things that I like about WordPress is that it is very welcoming and open to people like me, who don’t code at all. At the same time, it shows me a different way of looking at the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin believes in the power of WordPress to give ‘everyone a chance to learn new things’ and allows her to contribute and share her knowledge and experience. “By contributing, I hope to make a difference in someone’s life. I hope they feel the benefit of using WordPress and want to give back to create a healthier WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series.</a> #ContributorStory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@</a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>) for the interviews and writing this feature, and to Devin Maeztri (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/devinmaeztri/\">@devinmaeztri</a>) for sharing her story.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, today, folks, in our podcast, I am joined by a couple of special guests. I know it&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve had a guest, so I&#8217;m very excited to introduce you to who I have with me today. Today, I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onemaggie/\">Maggie Cabrera</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jffng/\">Jeff Ong</a>. They both are working on themes, and especially the future of themes as we move into this low code, no code block based experience of editing things in WordPress. And there have been so many questions lately about what does the landscape of being a theme developer turns into once we move fully into this excellent promise of user empowerment for Gutenberg? I figured who best to come and talk to us about that than these two. So welcome, Maggie. Welcome, Jeff. I&#8217;m really excited to have this conversation with you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>01:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having us. Excited to be here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just gonna hop right in, and we will see what happens. The first thing that I want to chat about, I hear so many questions and so much discussion about patterns in a lot of different places. Like obviously, the work that I helped to steward the most is around like the Block Pattern directory and various other user-facing tools. And so I have never really been able to give a really solid answer about like patterns and how they work inside themes. And so I wondered if you all had anything that you could offer to our listeners to help clarify what is the power of patterns inside themes in the future? Implementation of themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>02:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can try to start unless, Maggie? Okay. Well, if you take a look at what I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of months working on Twenty Twenty-Two. And if you look at that theme, it&#8217;s mostly just the collection of patterns. Patterns. As you know, if you read the description, the theme, it&#8217;s designed to be the most flexible and kind of like flexible theme ever, dare I say ever created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you can dare to say it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>03:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I think a huge part of that is because of the Full Site Editing being launched, introduced in 5.9. And also that theme itself ships with all of these patterns in it that work with the overall design, but really can be configured to your own kind of unique liking and kind of taste and ultimately, what you want to accomplish, whether that&#8217;s I want to make a portfolio, I want to make, you know, a single-page website promoting like my podcast, or there are patterns for that kind of shipping with the theme. And they&#8217;ve all been kind of designed and tailored to work with the typography choices at a baseline level with the color choices at a baseline level, but can very easily be tweaked. And you can kind of rely on them to work with the editor. And I guess, kind of zooming out for a little bit, not just about Twenty-Twenty Two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like patterns as this idea that a theme, hopefully, what it is, it&#8217;s a collection of different design options or layout options that are ultimately presented as patterns to the user, the patterns are just a really easy way to basically say &#8220;I want you this layout, like two columns of text or with like some images here.&#8221; Basically, a theme becomes a way of packaging the patterns together in a way that feels like a coherent piece of a coherent website. And I think that&#8217;s a pretty powerful idea. I know that the patterns directory is also opening up making those patterns pretty widely available. But I think a theme you could think of as like a curation of those patterns in a way that makes sense. And I think Twenty-Twenty Two is a really good example. I mean, I&#8217;m biased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s a good example. Maggie, did you have anything that you wanted to add to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>05:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, What I really like about patterns is how it empowers the user, even if they don&#8217;t really have like a deep knowledge of code, or they&#8217;re not used to the more complex blocks. When the theme developer gives you this pattern about using the query block, for example, it lays out your posts in a very compelling manner. And you can edit it if you want it or just use it out of the box. And you have this dynamic blog that it&#8217;s, like, such a big important part of your website. Like if you want to have a page where you have, you have maybe a podcast website, and you want to showcase your podcasts differently than your regular blog posts. So you can use a different gray pattern for that. And it&#8217;s like, really, really easy to use, even if you&#8217;re not familiar with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have found compelling about this new version of themes and kind of the way that themes are planning to look in the future; it&#8217;s going to be like a super throwback, so everyone get ready for me to sound old, my guests and my listeners alike. It reminds me of my original days of blogging on the web. I was not a developer and even though I had this really short stint of working with JavaScript in my career, at some point. Like no one actually would ever look to me and be like, that one is excellent at design and fixing everything with code, like I was just killer at searching for the right pieces of code, right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I remember sitting there on Zynga, which is, of course, now powered by WordPress, I absolutely just went out and found bundles of code that are now what we would consider themes and modified the small pieces that I needed to change in order to like really suit what I wanted to have happen on the site at the time. And they&#8217;re like, I knew I could break it all. Really easily. But also, it was, it was not scary to think about breaking it. Like it was clear how I could fix it if I really broke it. The content, like what I had written, was separate from everything to do with the way that it was looking. And so like, I wouldn&#8217;t destroy all of my work, just because I didn&#8217;t put a semicolon in the right place, or whatever it was in that moment. And so like, this future of themes really reminds me of this a lot where someone has curated how it can look how it should look. And you can just like add in modular pieces that will augment what was already intended, but still kind of work. And if it&#8217;s not gonna work, it&#8217;s kind of easy to fix too. So like, I&#8217;m excited. That was a really exciting time in my learning of the web and certainly was formative in my career, as we all now see. And so yeah, I think that&#8217;s really exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did have actually another question that this conversation has kind of brought up for me. I have, obviously just use the term modular, which no one has ever used in the context of themes for WordPress. And I know that there is a lot there are a lot of terms kind of wandering around about themes right now. And especially as we&#8217;re moving into what themes can look like in the future. There was block based theme as a term for a while. And now it&#8217;s block themes. There was like this floating around the term, universal themes. And now we&#8217;re looking at just like block themes forever. And so I wondered if y&#8217;all could give us a just like a clear understanding of these terms that had been being used and maybe are going out of fashion? Like, are they important for us to keep knowing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, the history of terms around themes. And obviously, even my knowledge only goes back so far. But it was around when we started doing the block based themes meeting. And trying to I think that&#8217;s where that term kind of came from is like, oh, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s start talking about this idea that themes can be completely made up out of blocks. And what does that mean?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think over time, it wasn&#8217;t just block themes, because, you know, previously, there were themes and even default themes that used and took into account the fact that blocks existed. So there was some confusion there. Enough time has gone on where we focus on this idea that themes whose templates are ultimately made out of blocks are block themes. And to me, it&#8217;s kind of as simple as that. Its themes that supply a set of templates that previously in the past were a collection of PHP and various template tags and whatnot is all transitioned to themes made up including other blocks, as well as themes that supply styles through theme.json configuration instead of supplying it in raw CSS. To me this idea is really crystallizing around like this is a block theme, one that is really, at its core, supplying a set of templates, and styles through a language that WordPress understands natively, and can allow it to be configured and customized in a really powerful way. And then maybe someday in the future, they&#8217;ll just be called themes again. If we do a good enough they will just be called themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna, I&#8217;m gonna take us into a philosophical area now that you&#8217;ve just put us in there. You said, someday they&#8217;ll be called Themes. Again, I&#8217;ve talked about this on this podcast a few times. And for anyone who&#8217;s worked with me for any length of time, like you all probably heard this from me as well. But like, adjectives are so frequently the realm of things that are not what you expect, right? Because like you have coffee, and then decaf coffee, no one&#8217;s like caffeinated coffee, because that&#8217;s what you expect out of it. And so when you&#8217;re like themes, and block themes, it makes it look like block themes are secondary, which at the moment, they are, ish. But in the future, I think you&#8217;re probably right, there will be a time when the modifier isn&#8217;t necessary anymore because it will be hopefully a much better way for people to kind of change the way that their themes work and make it more usable for users and people who are, you know, having to manage their own site without necessarily wanting to or being able to, like, have a Maggie in the room to fix everything that they break.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie is nowhere near me. And so she&#8217;s never been in the room when I&#8217;ve broken anything. But I believe that Maggie on one occasion, at least, has come in and helped me fix something that I definitely broke. I&#8217;m an excellent breaker of WordPress things. Maggie, did you have anything you wanted to add to that question?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I guess, maybe clarify a bit, what universal themes are because, yeah, maybe some people have heard about the term but they don&#8217;t really know what they are. And maybe just clarify that. The term was born when developing block themes wasn&#8217;t something that you could actually do for production websites like you could build them to test some experiments, but they weren&#8217;t really ready for users to use. So universal themes want to grasp the power of love themes while still being ready for users. So the way they do it is they are block based, like we used to call them in the sense that the templates are made of blocks. But they are also able to be customized using the customizer, which is the old way of customizing themes, instead of using the site editor. So they can have a balance between two worlds between the worlds of classic themes and block themes. But they are, at heart, a temporary concept. They are bound to be blocked themes in the future, but with maybe a foot in the past, where they can actually serve users who are not ready for full-on site editor. But they are bound to be full block themes in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a really interesting concept in there. So universal themes, it sounds like are basically kind of like an on-ramp for people who are not really ready to fully commit to this for any number of reasons. Like we never want to say that we know the reason that people would be a little bit shy to get started with this. But like it&#8217;s kind of like an on-ramp, it&#8217;s a safe way to get back to something that they do know, in the event that what they don&#8217;t know, really hinders their progress makes it hard for them to get the work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I wouldn&#8217;t say that they are for people shyer to get into new stuff rather than developers who want to embrace the new stuff before it&#8217;s even really ready. They really want to embrace the power of the blocks instead of doing things the old way. But even if it&#8217;s not fully ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>14:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They still need to support the old way of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like being backward compatible and being ready for any kind of user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mostly for developers, everyone who heard me just talking about how it was a great thing for users, ignore it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>15:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also good for users; If they feel secure in using the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think that there&#8217;s something important here that we certainly learned with the adoption of Gutenberg in 5.0. Right, which is that there is certainly one method of helping people to adopt things, which is to go like the art of war style, and kind of smash their rice pots and burn all their boats, like, that&#8217;s one way. Which works for a lot of companies in the world, I&#8217;m sure. But WordPress has always had kind of a commitment, not even kind of, has always had a commitment to backward compatibility. And like, we know that a lot of the work on Gutenberg is going to represent some breaking changes around the around workflows and around the user experience the interface, especially like, we know that. But the opportunity to like have a thing that gives you an early taste of what&#8217;s coming but also the ability to keep kind of working in your old space where you need to, I think it&#8217;s an excellent way to bring people forward into the future of things, I have never been a fan of the just like cut off all avenues and hope that they stay with your method because of course, like you can&#8217;t cut off all the methods. You can&#8217;t cut off all the ways people can get away from you. And even if we could, it wouldn&#8217;t be in line with how WordPress hopes to kind of help people through some tough stuff like making your first website is hard. If you are doing it as part of, an overall campaign that&#8217;s supposed to bring in leads for you or generate revenue like you don&#8217;t want to necessarily play with that in a way that could break things and be risky for you in the long term. So I think all the tools that we offer to help people kind of move forward with the technology move forward with the CMS as it&#8217;s moving forward, I think it&#8217;s really smart. And so universal themes are one of those things, but also not around to stay. As we move into non modified themes, just the word themes that happen to be based in blocks. If I&#8217;ve confused anyone, please email me at wpbriefing@wordpress.org. And tell me how I confused you. And I will do a follow-up to unconfuse everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So speaking of the way that we help people kind of move forward with WordPress and with the technology. So much has been done in the CMS in the past 12 months in the past 18 months to be able to move themes into this same future as the rest of the editor. Right. So like, for folks who have not been listening to me for the last five years, you may not know this. So I&#8217;m going to tell everybody now, like one of the pain points that Gutenberg overall is solving is the fact that you for a long time had to learn five different editing interfaces to get one thing done in WordPress, right. And so like the advent of blocks and moving it into more and more spaces in the CMS is intended to really flatten the editing experience by making the type of user interaction the type of workflow really similar across all of the editing interfaces in the CMS. And so themes are a natural extension of that, where we can take similar user patterns and workflows, and work them out into themes. So over the last 12 months or so probably a little bit more, there&#8217;s been a lot of work on the CMS to move us forward in that that is now enabling the work that we want to be able to do to move things forward ahead. And so, I mean, this is probably our last question. Is there anything that you all want to offer to people who maybe saw themes early on or saw Gutenberg early on and felt like this is just not for me, in that in that context of like, how far it&#8217;s moved ahead in the past 12 months or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>19:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re asking like, what in the last 12 months has maybe like really surprised me or like sticks out to me as something that like, Wow, look how far we&#8217;ve come?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. So like, if you&#8217;re looking at what is the one thing that you saw in the last 12 months, that changed in the CMS that really enabled something wonderful for themes or from the other side of it. Like if someone had looked at themes or WordPress 18 months ago, and now they&#8217;re looking at it and seeing this new and different way to do things with the look and feel of their site, like what is one thing that they should be aware of? On either side of that question,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>20:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s more than one thing that has really evolved through this last year, year and a half. Like the maturity of some of the blocks is astounding now, like navigation blog, for example, was really bare-bones at the start and now it&#8217;s full potential, and it&#8217;s really looking really great. I would say the same thing about those days or the features on fire, like how basic it was at the start, was full potential. But now it&#8217;s really, really mature in terms of how much you can do with it. Like, I think the example, the perfect example of that is the work that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kjellr/\">Kjell [Reigstad]</a> has done on Twenty-Twenty Two with the alternative theme.json files, where just changing that file basically feels like a new theme, with just the configuration and the styles. And without writing any CSS without changing any templates. It&#8217;s really, really amazing how that can turn into a reality. And it&#8217;s so easy for users to tinker with that if they want to. And it&#8217;s much easier than having to delve deep into CSS and changing everything in like 2000 lines of code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>21:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I probably would echo most of that. What the thing that astounds me is global styles and how the UI can be shipping a theme or default theme with basically like, 20 lines of CSS, and have it be one of them. A beautiful, beautiful, like crisp and sharp, like, experience. It&#8217;s super fast. And it&#8217;s like, what this is a theme, you know, I thought a theme was supposed to supply all the styles like no, like, it&#8217;s just yeah. And workers do for you. Exactly. And like that. That&#8217;s pretty amazing to think in the last 12 months, we can go from, you know, shipping 1000s of lines of CSS to you none, it&#8217;s like, Wow, pretty cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my friends, thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a really interesting conversation. I hope that all y&#8217;all out listening. Also find it interesting. As I mentioned, if you have any follow-up questions, absolutely. Send them to me via email. And I collect all of my questions that I get through the year for answering at the end of the year, mostly because I don&#8217;t get lots of questions that people want to be answered on this. Everyone just asked me their questions on Twitter and in Slack, which is fine as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Maggie, Jeff, thank you both for joining me. And I&#8217;m sure that we&#8217;ll talk to you all again soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. In the last episode, I got all excited about being in the beta phase. But today, I&#8217;m rolling that back a little bit. As part of our usual open source processes, a group of contributors did a deep dive review on the WordPress 5.9 release and found a workflow that needed some refinement. So we are delaying the beta.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we are in the midst of a major commerce slash/sales season, and of course, a lengthy holiday season, that delay also means that it makes sense to delay WordPress 5.9 final release a little as well. And so we are delaying that all the way into 2022 to January 25. For me, the trade-off works really well there. Every decision that we make in open source, of course, has some balance to it. It&#8217;s great for these aspects, it is less great for these aspects over here. But for myself, the opportunity to make sure that we have a really excellent experience for our users and also an opportunity to kind of avoid all of the chaos and hustle and bustle of the end of the year. Really, it seemed like a no-brainer for me. So in case you want to learn a little bit more about why we made the decision and get some insight into the actual milestones and where they have moved now, I&#8217;ll include some posts in the show notes below in case you want to read more and of course, if you have any additional questions you can always ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second small list of big things is that the first back to people WordCamp. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re calling it. Our first back to people WordCamp is happening in a couple of weeks actually. WordCamp Sevilla is happening in person on December 11. And I&#8217;m so excited I wish I were local, but I&#8217;m not so if you are local stop by their website and pick up your ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our smallest a big things is that it is, of course, charitable giving season. I don&#8217;t know if you do your charitable giving at the end of the year or if that&#8217;s even part of your general ways of giving back. But I can think of two or three charitable organizations inside the WordPress ecosystem. There&#8217;s of course the WordPress Foundation, but also Big Orange Heart and HeroPress. If there are others out there, I certainly do want to know about them. WordPress Foundation also does additional giving on behalf of just like the open web and open source as a whole. So if you&#8217;re the sort of person who does their charitable giving at the end of the year, just a reminder that you have some options inside the WordPress ecosystem if you were trying to figure out some new places to donate to in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you so much for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. Thank you again to our special guests, Maggie and Jeff. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11636\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Watch State of the Word at a Watch Party with your WordPress Friends\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/watch-state-of-the-word-at-a-watch-party-with-your-wordpress-friends/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:30:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11641\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:322:\"State of the Word 2021 is just around the corner!&#160; Although attending State of the Word in person would be ideal, not all WordPress community members get to enjoy the experience of attending the speech live with friends.&#160; This year, as State of the Word is streamed live for the second time, we want to [&#8230;]\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Hari Shanker R\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20055:\"\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">State of the Word 2021</a> is just around the corner!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although attending State of the Word in person would be ideal, not all WordPress community members get to enjoy the experience of attending the speech live with friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, as State of the Word is streamed live for the second time, we want to restore that in person camaraderie through State of the Word watch parties for WordPress Community members around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>We encourage WordPress meetup organizers and community members worldwide to (safely) host State of the Word 2021 watch parties —</strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/2021-state-of-the-word-watch-parties/\"><strong>read this handbook to learn more</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-organize-a-watch-party\">Why organize a watch party?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you are a <a href=\"https://meetup.com/pro/wordpress\">WordPress meetup</a> organizer, many folks in your meetup may be unaware of the State of the Word, and a watch party could be a great opportunity to introduce or remind them.</li><li>As meetup organizers slowly bid goodbye to a tough year, the watch party could be an excellent opportunity to revitalize your group, especially if you haven’t had many events this year.</li><li>Along with your Meetup group members, you get a platform to ask questions directly to Matt Mullenweg.</li><li>And last but not least, even if you are not a Meetup Organizer, a watch party can be the perfect opportunity to reconnect and have a blast with your WordPress friends!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-organize-a-state-of-the-word-watch-party\">How do I organize a State of the Word watch party?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to host a watch party online or in person.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was in a meeting recently, which I realize isn&#8217;t saying much for me since I spend a quarter of my time in meetings. But in this particular meeting, I was asked a couple of questions that I absolutely loved. The first question was, “if there were one thing you could change in people&#8217;s minds about WordPress, what would it be?” And my answer, predictable though it may be, was that I want to change the idea that WordPress is just a blogging platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has grown into a lot more than that. But the idea of a content management system, even now, sometimes gets a mental shorthand where content is a stand-in for the word writing or words. If you&#8217;re using WordPress today in an enterprise context, or as part of a governmental agency, or if you use it in a classroom setting, you know that your content cannot be confined that way. And if you&#8217;re supporting or building anything to hand off to clients, you know that timely, easy-to-ship changes on a site are considered a vital part of any overarching brand and marketing strategy. And when was the last time that any marketing strategy was literally only about the words?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was the first question. And also my first answer. There is also this kind of annual, not fear, necessarily, but this annual question that is sort of related that is raised to me and has been asked of me recently, that I&#8217;m just going to give you a small answer to. One annual worry that I get every year around November and December is, &#8220;What are we going to do about the fact that the term blog and blogging are declining in search popularity?&#8221; And I was gonna say it&#8217;s been a while since I answered that in any sort of public format. But I think maybe I&#8217;ve never answered it in a public format at all. And so I&#8217;m just going to answer it here. Because I think maybe a lot of people have that same question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So number one, I think that the way that people search now is different. There&#8217;s a lot more semantic cognition. This is not the way to answer this &#8212;  search engines are smarter now. So like, it used to be the case with early search engines that yeah, there was a lot of just like, individual search terms that were looked for. But now, people are asking full questions; they have, essentially, an entire sentence that they are searching for. And then, search engines are able to parse that information better and get more high-quality answers and information for them. So like, that&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m already not worried about. If people are searching for individual words anymore, it&#8217;s so that they can get a definition of that word. So I&#8217;m not specifically worried about a decline in search volume for the word blog or blogging for that reason. But the answer to my first question, if there is probably the real reason that I&#8217;m not actually super worried about any decline in search volume for the word blog, or blogging, is that WordPress has really moved beyond that. And since we have moved beyond that, then it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make sense for WordPress as an entity for WordPress as a project to get overly hung up on the idea that the term blog has gone out of fashion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, now that I did my first question, and the answer, and then an additional question that only ever gets asked in private and is being answered by me for the first time in public, I will tell you now, the second question that I loved, someone asking of me, and that question is this: &#8220;What is one thing you&#8217;d like people to see or experience, right when they first land on wordpress.org?&#8221; Now, I often don&#8217;t get asked questions about the wordpress.org website, like administrative tasks, things that we need to update, move around where they should go. Sure. But like, “Josepha, what&#8217;s the point and purpose of this site?” Never. I&#8217;ve never been asked that, and so I was really excited that someone asked me, and I&#8217;m going to give you a heads up. I think some of you might disagree with my answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the primary thing that I want people to see or experience when they first get to wordpress.org, the website is the depth of WordPress. Not which audience segment they should belong to or that we believe they should belong to or raw data about the CMS or even how much we care about the freedoms of open source. Now the first thing I want people to see on that site is that WordPress has not only 18 years of learned knowledge that every single new user benefits from, but that it also has 1,000s of really smart people making sure it works and gets better every day, now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is a Goliath in its field. I know that we cite this bit of context. Frequently, we say that we are 42% of the web. And that is true that is the percentage by usage. But in its field, which is websites that are using a content management system, we actually have a 65% market share. This is very easy to find. It&#8217;s on the W3Techs website: I can put a link in the show notes, but you could find it just by searching for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress is a Goliath in its field of websites that are run using a CMS. Because we have always brought our learnings forward with us with the understanding that knowledge, when shared grows rather than diminishes. But open source, the heart of what defines this project, open source is not a Goliath; it&#8217;s barely even David somedays. Even though the web is built on scads of open source software, there&#8217;s a pervasive public perception that it is built by and for hobbyists or that it is inherently risky, and that if there were if it were worth something, then people would pay something. And I just know that if the first impression of WordPress, we&#8217;re, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got 18 years of experience and learning that brought us to today,&#8221; the rest of the sale to adopt software that protects other people&#8217;s freedoms would take care of itself. And I guess, to quote John Oliver, at this point, &#8220;And now this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, that brings us now to our small list of big things. There are actually quite a few big things on this small list today. So number one, we have reached the beta phase for the year&#8217;s final release, which means that WordPress 5.9 beta one is happening tomorrow, Tuesday, November 16. And then seven days later, I believe on the 23rd, if I recall correctly, comes beta two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that team rep nominations are happening all over the project right now. I&#8217;ve got a post that I will share in the notes below that I believe all the team reps have put their team&#8217;s nomination posts on. So if you have had an interest in learning more about that and what it means to help keep teams kind of running in the WordPress project, then this is a great opportunity to check those out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing, this last thing actually isn&#8217;t in the next two weeks, but it is very important, nonetheless. Matt&#8217;s annual State of the Word is coming up on December 14. So basically a month from today. It&#8217;s going to join the growing list of in-person events that are on the calendar. It will be in New York City but will also be live-streamed across the world as usual. Keep an eye out for additional updates about that for anyone who, like me, really looks forward to this particular presentation from our project co-founder every year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things.

I have been tinkering with many of the features as they were committed over the last couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some things that I am excited about. The Web Fonts API is something I have patiently waited months for, but the ability to quickly nest Group blocks within other Groups has earned a spot in my most-loved enhancements list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new keyboard shortcut for auto-completing links is now available. Users should also enjoy cleaner loading states for the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39275\">Media &amp; Text</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38907\">Navigation</a> blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Web Fonts API</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing various web fonts.\n\n\n\n<p>The long-awaited <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37140\">Web Fonts API</a> is in the Gutenberg plugin. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\">road was long and bumpy</a> getting here, but it feels good to arrive at the destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can now bundle font files with their themes and register them via <code>theme.json</code> or the <code>wp_register_webfonts()</code> function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside is that the implementation only supports locally-hosted fonts. In the long term, this will create large theme ZIP packages as developers begin to ship global style variations, each with its own fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ari Stathopoulos, who has put months of work into the API, also has a patch that would <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39350\">integrate with Google Fonts</a>. The enhancement would solve the GDPR and related privacy issues because the font files would be downloaded from Google and loaded from the server. However, the feature seems to be a non-starter based on a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36394#issuecomment-981970167\">comment from a lead developer</a> in a previous discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent comment on my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-web-fonts-api-has-arrived\">earlier coverage of the Web Fonts API</a>, Stathopoulos <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-web-fonts-api-has-arrived#comment-418942\">said the following</a> about his hopes for Google Fonts integration:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For better or worse I don’t expect it will be merged, but it will be enough to start a discussion and eventually find a solution to all the issues that come with the use of 3rd-party webfont providers.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is too early to see how the lack of a Google Fonts provider will play out with theme authors. However, I expect many will build a custom provider implementation or not use the new API at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Grouping Groups</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Putting a Group in a Group in a Group.\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever created a Group block, worked on a few things, and later realized you needed to wrap the original Group within another Group? Then, did you have to work through a complicated series of tasks of copying your current blocks and pasting them into an entirely new Group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I feel your pain.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39062\">no longer the agonizing process</a> it once was. If not for the new Web Fonts API, this would be the highlight of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the toolbar Options dropdown (vertical ellipsis), users should see a Group option when another Group is selected. Nesting them has never been easier than clicking that button.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shortcut for Adding Inline Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inline link inserter.\n\n\n\n<p>The latest update adds an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29172\">inline shortcut for links</a> by typing <code>[[</code> in a Rich Text area, such as a Paragraph block. This should be a welcome feature for users who like to insert links while writing but do not want their hands to leave the keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, I thought this feature was not working. The inserter did not appear as swiftly as expected, so I hit the spacebar on my keyboard, thinking I needed to trigger it somehow. However, that did not work. Essentially, it was slow for me, which may have been my computer or connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typing <code>[[</code> followed by some other characters seems to work the best. For example, if I am looking for the <em>What a Wonderful Day</em> post, I just start typing the post name: <code>[[what a...</code>. The link inserter appears by the time I am a few characters in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to see more of a Markdown-style auto-completer for links. Typing <code>[some text]</code> should trigger the link inserter. The <code>[[</code> syntax feels odd at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, it is not something I would use in my workflow. I tend to get all the text in place and add links during the editing phase. The editor already makes it easy for my workflow by allowing me to highlight any text and paste a URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Core Blocks Shown First in Global Styles</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Block sorted in the global styles panel.\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg will now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39093\">show the core blocks first</a> in the global styles panel in the site editor. Those from plugins get pushed to the bottom of the pile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not help much when looking for a single block among the dozens listed. Alphabetizing them would help, but it could also push oft-used blocks like Paragraph down the list. The sidebar has limited space, but I would like to see blocks grouped by their categories here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building Themes from the Site Editor…<em>almost</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Exporting a customized Twenty Twenty-Two theme.\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release brings us one step closer to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39189\">creating themes entirely</a> from the WordPress site editor. I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-dream-of-exporting-wordpress-block-themes-from-the-site-editor-is-close-to-reality\">covered this feature</a> in more depth earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users could download a ZIP file of their templates and parts from the editor in earlier releases. The new export includes the <code>theme.json</code>, <code>style.css</code>, and <code>index.php</code> files from the theme. The <code>theme.json</code> file also adds user customizations from the global styles panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the export could be an entire theme (minus the screenshot) if it does not require a <code>functions.php</code> or include font files from the new API. However, that is a rare scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Code Block Styling Moved to <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> Element</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Doubled padding and borders on Code block.\n\n\n\n<p>Before now, when using the Code block, WordPress placed custom styles on the inner <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> inline HTML element instead of the wrapping <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element. Things like padding, backgrounds, and borders made little sense on the child element. I had always thought it was an odd practice, and it was something I had rarely seen before outside of that specific case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, as a theme designer, I tried to fight it. However, I eventually caved because I wanted to build block themes the &#8220;right way&#8221; by using <code>theme.json</code> and allowing users to customize the look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 12.8 corrects this issue by <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38712\">moving the styles</a> to the outer <code>&lt;pre></code> element.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this may be a breaking change for some themes. Authors who target <code>.wp-block-code > code</code> in their CSS may need to update their code before WordPress 6.0. It depends on whether it was literally meant for the inline <code>&lt;code></code> element or was a workaround for WordPress&#8217;s previous mishap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the interim, this is only a partial fix when themes have the <code>should_load_separate_block_assets</code> flag enabled, which is the default case for all block themes. When running Gutenberg alongside WordPress 5.9, the Code block styles are applied to both the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and the inner <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements in the editor. That means that the block could have double borders, padding, and other styles that might make it look a bit off right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This problem is not specific to the Code block. Instead, it is a broader issue, which <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39393\">now has an open ticket</a>. I only wish this ticket had been fixed first, avoiding this transition period with broken styles.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 03:47:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org to Launch Pattern Creator to Expand Pattern Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=131542\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-to-launch-pattern-creator-to-expand-pattern-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2941:\"<p>WordPress.org&#8217;s contributors are preparing to open the doors of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Pattern Directory</a> to public submissions. Patterns&#8217; transformative effect on page building in the block editor has made the feature important enough to earn its own directory in July 2021.  For the past nine months, it has been limited to a small, curated selection of patterns from designers in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Alex Shiels <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/03/16/coming-soon-block-pattern-directory-submissions/\">unveiled</a> the new Pattern Creator that will enable public pattern submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/new-pattern/\">Pattern Creator page</a>&nbsp;will allow designers and content creators to build, edit, and submit their best&nbsp;block&nbsp;patterns to the directory,&#8221; Shiels said. &#8220;Approved patterns will be added to the directory, where they will be instantly available to the authors of millions of WordPress sites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pattern Creator loads an instance of the block editor where the Publish button has been swapped out for a Submit button. Using only WordPress core blocks, pattern designers are encouraged to create something unique that other people might want to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Pattern designers are not permitted to upload their own images but the media library is hooked up to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/openverse/\">Openverse</a> for access to license-free images. After putting all the elements in place for the pattern, designers can select a category, add some keywords for search, and submit the pattern to the directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Shiels said the Pattern Creator is expected to officially launch next week but the Meta team is inviting designers and theme developers to help test the submission process now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advent of FSE (full-site editing) in WordPress 5.9, Pattern Directory contributors anticipate pattern authors may soon be submitting more site building type patterns, such as headers, footers, and query blocks. This is also important now that themes have <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38323\">gained the ability to register patterns from directory</a> with theme.json. Contributors are still working on a way to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/395\">categorize and show &#8220;site building&#8221; block patterns</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Pattern Directory currently has a few simple, artful patterns, it is lacking in variety. Ideally, users would have multiple patterns to choose from when selecting among pricing tables, social cards, contact information, and other frequently used website building blocks.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the future of blocks outside of WordPress. If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WP Tavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d really like to hear from anyone out there who would like to come onto the podcast and talk about whatever it is that you do with WordPress. It might be that you&#8217;re a developer, a WordCamp organizer, a contributor, a designer. Honestly, if it&#8217;s about WordPress, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you on the show. Head over to WP Tavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Leonardo Losoviz. He&#8217;s here to talk about the block protocol. Ever since WordPress 5.0 was released several years ago. We&#8217;ve been using blocks to create content inside of WordPress. More and more blocks have been developed to manage the creation of content, and the display of this content on the front end. With WordPress 5.9, anyone using a block-based theme is able to manage more of their site with blocks. The header, the footer, menus and more. It&#8217;s a real shift in the way that content and sites are created and puts the end user in control of the way that their website looks. But the content that you create with your WordPress blocks are limited to your website. It&#8217;s not just WordPress that&#8217;s using blocks though. Go to almost any modern SaaS app and you&#8217;ll see content blocks in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such an easy process to understand. You want text, use a text block. Perhaps an image, well use the image block. In this way, non-technical users can build up their content easily. For obvious reasons, every app and CMS, which is using blocks has built their own implementation for their own needs. The needs of their users and their customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block protocol is a new attempt to unify the way that blocks work, so that if you create a block on your WordPress site, the same content could be consumed and used elsewhere, seamlessly. The reverse would be true as well. If you stop to think about it, this is a really powerful idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leonardo talks to us today about the block protocol, what is, and how it might work. We discuss some of the benefits that the protocol might bring, as well as some of the barriers which are undoubtedly in the way of its development and adoption. Who might benefit from using such a protocol, and whether or not we can realistically expect this to be implemented in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes. Head over to WP Tavern.com forward slash podcast. And look for episode number 18. And so without further delay, I bring you Leonardo Losoviz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Leonardo Losoviz. Hello Leonardo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> Hey, Nathan, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very good. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today. We&#8217;ll get stuck into the main content a little bit later. We&#8217;re going to be talking today about something called the block protocol. But before that a little introduction from you, Leonardo, if that&#8217;s okay, how come you&#8217;re on a WordPress podcast? What is it that draws you to WordPress? Are you a coder or a developer? What&#8217;s your background with tech?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:24] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> I&#8217;m a developer. I&#8217;ve been working with WordPress since 2012 I believe. And, I work or I have a plugin that is a GraphQL server for WordPress and I work with that pretty much every day. And as I develop the plugin I have insights on other topics. So in particular, the whole of the block protocol is one of the things that I could connect to because of my background with GraphQL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much indeed. Now I&#8217;m going to draw everybody&#8217;s attention to an article. I will link to it in the show notes. So if you&#8217;re not familiar, go to WP Tavern.com forward slash podcast, and today&#8217;s episode will be listed there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in that set of show notes will be links to all of the bits and pieces that we happen to mention today. And the first one is an article that you wrote on the smashing magazine website called implications of WordPress joining the block protocol. This is an idea that was raised really recently. The idea being that there is this third party idea, it&#8217;s not a WordPress idea and it&#8217;s called the block protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you just like to very, in the broadest possible terms? Just tell us what the block protocol is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:37] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> All right. I will try my best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> So the block protocol is an idea to get blocks to be interoperable between different applications. So right now, when we are using WordPress, we have the WordPress editor. We are composing a blog post with blocks and seeing the latest version of WordPress, version 5.9. We can also create layouts. We can create the full site, via what&#8217;s called a full site editor ,via blocks. Now these blocks that we&#8217;re using on WordPress, they can only be used in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s this guy, Joel Spolsky a very famous guy. He created a stack overflow., If I&#8217;m not, if I&#8217;m not wrong. Yeah. So he came up with this idea called the block protocol, and the idea will be to get the blocks in this case from WordPress, but from any other software tool and to port them into whichever other application. Be it based on WordPress or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the idea is that now we can reuse blocks among applications the same way that we can reuse components like JavaScript components nowadays. So for instance if you&#8217;re a developer, and possibly you have coded a component for React, and then you have another website for another client, you can reuse the same component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the idea is to do something similar with blocks. That you have developed a block for your WordPress site. And the day after tomorrow you have a different application, which is based on Node JS or on a different CMS. And you want to reuse the same block that you have for your WordPress site. With the block protocol, you could do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, everybody I would imagine who&#8217;s listening to this podcast has some familiarity with the new block editor. That is to say, rewind to WordPress 5.0 in come blocks. Blocks are now the way that we create all content, and increasingly the way that we create everything around our website, especially with the 5.9 release and full site editing and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what may not be obvious to most users is that that content is, it is completely siloed within WordPress. So as you&#8217;ve just described, if you create some text or you create an image, you are really going to struggle in any meaningful way to take that and put it somewhere else. The best you can really hope for is going in and copying and putting it into your clipboard on your computer and then going and pasting it elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the intention, I believe of the block protocol, is to make it so that applications, no matter where they are based, there&#8217;ll be able to communicate with each other. And the picture that you put inside of Gutenberg would be available to some other piece of software that&#8217;s nothing to do with WordPress. Have I more or less summed it up there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:22] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> Yeah. What you have to take into account is that with the blocks, you create content. So when we&#8217;re talking about content, you can copy paste it into different application, it&#8217;s all HTML at the end of the day. It will work here. It will work there. But blocks, we&#8217;re talking about functionality. About being able to use this functionality to create the content in first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So think of any block that you might actually think of, say a Google map, that you can point and click on the map, and then you have the location that you want to display. So this is functionality. Like behind the functionality you will be producing HTML, which is the embedding of the Google map. But you&#8217;ll know, you need to know how to code HTML to do that. You don&#8217;t want to do that. You want to do it with a WYSIWYG. That is, visual that you click on a dynamic map. This functionality is a block, and this is the functionality that we want to port across applications. So this is more than content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Perfect. Thank you so much for clarifying that. Okay. The article, at the beginning, you go to, you go into explain how Joel Spolsky he has got this project called the block protocol. And again, I will link in the show notes to that so that you can go and find the website there. There&#8217;s a fairly impressive website where they explain things in pretty good detail with lots of documentation, and so on. But the reason that we&#8217;re talking, is that it would appear that fairly recently, Matt Mullenweg reached out to Joel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was that way round or Joel reaching out to Matt, but either way some conversation began, I believe it was perhaps on Twitter, where Matt was essentially saying, look, it would be really interesting if we could make all of this work with Gutenberg blocks. So in other words, why don&#8217;t we see if there&#8217;s some possibility of making your block protocol and WordPress work together. So that stuff can be egress and enter WordPress websites, to other different parts of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in order to understand this better, you then went on to explain how a block is actually created. You&#8217;ve got this paragraph entitled what is a block. And I think, for most users of WordPress, if you&#8217;re a developer this obviously would be different, but if you&#8217;re a casual user of WordPress or you&#8217;re a publisher or an implementer, it might be that in the block editor, you just see the block and it&#8217;s a little rectangular icon and you click the button and it comes onto the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a lot of incredible technology going on in the background. And I just wonder if you could explain to those of us who don&#8217;t necessarily understand, what is a block what&#8217;s actually going on in the background?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:00] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> All right. If you do not understand what a block is, that&#8217;s good. You do not need to understand. All you need to do is to be able to use it. So this is, it&#8217;s complex in the sense that, you know, the simpler something is to be used, the more difficult it is to implement. Which is the great thing about Apple products. You know, that the box is just white. But that whiteness, they have a huge team of designers to come up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the block, if you&#8217;re able to use a WordPress editor, then the book already succeeded. You don&#8217;t need to understand how it works or what it is, apart from the fact that you need to use it to create content, which is in this case to write a blog post or, since the later version of WordPress to create the full, the overall site, by clicking at elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then what is a block? It&#8217;s a concept. It&#8217;s a unit of something, in this case it&#8217;s code, that you interact with to create content on the site. If you&#8217;re a developer, you will be developing blocks. You can be a designer and that you will be applying styles to blocks. But at the end of the day, it&#8217;s a concept. It&#8217;s not really an implementation. It&#8217;s just this idea of what you said, you know, like a square, that you click on the square possibly, and something will happen on the website. You will have created content. So yeah, it&#8217;s one of those things that now it appears everywhere because WordPress is trying to make it widespread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what Matt Mullenweg had attempted to do with his concept of reducing the different interfaces that we have to interact with. So in the past with WordPress, you could create content via short codes or with the classic editor, or with the customizer. The block replaces all of these. You had to learn only one thing, which is the block, the interface with the block, and you&#8217;re able to create your website, whatever it is that you need to create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you want to add a video. You want to embed a picture, something very simple. But now also we have more functionality, like editing pictures and possibly even editing videos in the future. It&#8217;s taking more roles. It is like an application to create cotent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess this approach is absolutely lovely. You&#8217;ve got a nice little graphic on your website where you talk about the fact that the block is kind of a container for all sorts of child components. So you could have all sorts of different things inside your block. So a block doesn&#8217;t just have to be one simple thing. It could be a multitude of layered things which could become incredibly complicated. But the point is the block encapsulates them all, but it&#8217;s siloed within WordPress. You can&#8217;t easily get it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And well, maybe there are ways that you can get it out, but it&#8217;s not relatively straightforward for the likes of me. So along comes Joel Spolsky with his block protocol. And the idea is that he would like all of these different bits and pieces to be interoperable. So that a block on WordPress might be able to interact, and I believe on the article that you wrote, you mentioned a couple of things. You mentioned a SaaS product called Notion, which is a bit like a note taking app, but it&#8217;s much more complicated than that. You can do all sorts of things like add bullet lists and what have you. And the premise therefore would be well, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we could take the content that we&#8217;ve created inside of Gutenberg, inside of WordPress, and we could just have it so that it was completely interoperable and it was transparent. You could throw it over for example, to Notion or anything else. So is that the dream here is that what Joel and his block protocol is trying to enable? To make there a standard set of ways of doing things, such that everything, everywhere can communicate with anything else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:56] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> Yeah, you said just right. It is a dream. It&#8217;s something that seems to be a bit out of reach. So far it&#8217;s a potential, it&#8217;s an idea, but from idea to implementation, it&#8217;s a long road. In particular, I don&#8217;t think that Notion will want to be part of this movement because there&#8217;s nothing in it for them. I believe that Notion has spent so much time and money developing their own blocks. So I don&#8217;t see why they will be sharing them with the wider world. Basically, if they give us their blocks, we can embed them in our WordPress site and recreate Notion. And this is the same with Medium. I don&#8217;t see them participating in this idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now they could still use it, because a block protocol is a protocol. You can use it for your own internal use. That means that Medium or Notion they could have sub applications, or they could have their own internal team, their own development team, that they have internal applications and they could use the block protocol to reuse their own blocks within their own applications. But that will not be shared with us. We are using WordPress and I don&#8217;t expect to have Notion give the WordPress users access to their blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So I guess where you&#8217;ve got a proprietary piece of software and their way of creating revenue I suppose, is on their, the system that they&#8217;ve built with components and blocks and the ability to have a beautiful UI and all of that. It&#8217;s unlikely in your estimation that they would wish to become part of this because it removes that unique value proposition. If it&#8217;s simple to put that data in exactly the same form elsewhere, it&#8217;s unlikely they would want to be a part of that because it upsets that business model. However, that being said all is not lost. The block protocol opens up the opportunity for lots of different scenarios, not necessarily the SaaS proprietary platforms that we mentioned, but in your piece, you go on to describing in quite a large amount of detail that the types of people, teams, and applications, and so on that you feel the block protocol would fit well with. So should we just delve into this? Who might want to use the block protocol?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:07] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> Okay. First one is, if you do not have money, which is quite a general condition for a lot of startups, then you would want to use a block, develop protocol to use blocks that are already developed by somebody else, that you can just customize for your own use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is important because coding blocks is labor intensive. You need a dedicated team and that&#8217;s money and that&#8217;s time. Think about WordPress. The WordPress editor, up to now, it took five years. You have been started five years ago. And now only now after five years we have full site editing. I believe that, that was not their idea when they launch it at the very beginning or when they were planning at the very beginning. They had never expected that it will take five years to be at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took that time because high quality software takes time to produce. Think about the accessibility issues that it will have in at the very beginning, which were fixed, but it took time. So once again, if you want to create a website using blocks and you had to create it from scratch. Then you&#8217;re going to be spending a lot of money. Now you could alternatively, depend on the block protocol, use the blocks by WordPress and just customize them for your own application. So that&#8217;s the first one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one is if you have a website that you want it to be fancy, or you want to be appealing, like Medium, like Notion, but it&#8217;s kind of falling behind because, you know, I mean, we all share the same users. So I think that&#8217;s Facebook when it came out, it was a sort of tragedy for website developers who didn&#8217;t have a lot of money to hire a team because people are expecting the same quality as Facebook. Like interactivity, dynamic functionality. Eventually they released React and we could do the same, but it takes time and it takes effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then once again, you need to compete against these guys. If your website is not looking good, you will fall behind, nobody going to come to your website anymore. And nowadays the technology barrier is quite high in the sense, design is so amazing. Some websites out there are so amazing and they&#8217;re are all for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if somebody developed really nice looking blocks and you don&#8217;t want to fall behind, you can just use it. So in my article, I was using Mailchimp as an example, because the Mailchimp editor for creating the newsletters, it was kind of falling behind a bit. I had noticed that they were experimenting with a new editor, which was similar to the WordPress editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot find it anymore. It was buggy and I just couldn&#8217;t use it for long, and I revert back to their current experience. So I was wondering if Mailchimp could benefit from using the WordPress blocks. So you can see WordPress, MailChimp is a multi-billion company. Like, I don&#8217;t know, ten billion dollars recently or something like that. So they could benefit from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I believe that as a content management systems in particular, I quote Drupal, they could use it because Drupal has already expressed interest in using Gutenberg. In using the WordPress editor for creating content. So now with the block protocol, it will be easier to achieve this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason why it will be easier is because WordPress right now, when you develop, the WordPress editor doesn&#8217;t need to care about anyone. They just care about themselves. So at the same time that you create the functionality, on the client side, all the dynamic stuff, the layouts and everything. There has to be a backend that can field the functionality. So we have the WordPress Rest API. So whenever you have a new block, possibly the block will need a new Rest endpoint to fetch data and interact with the server. All of that is happening on WordPress and WordPress needs to certify it. But right now WordPress only cares about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know WordPress can certify its own requirements. Then it&#8217;s good to go. So Drupal right now needs to be catching up with WordPress all the time. If WordPress 5.8 comes out and Drupal catches up with it, and then on WordPress 5.9, they changed the API and they&#8217;re having a bit of changes lately. Then Dupal will need to also change its own API to catch up. So it&#8217;s a lot of effort to be playing catch up all the time. But if we, if they go through the block protocol, WordPress cannot go it alone anymore. They will need to satisfy a requirement imposed by a third party. So then Drupal could say, okay, now we&#8217;re integrating into WordPress anymore, all I need to do to certify this contract with this clear guidelines, set up by the third party, and as long as I do this and WordPress does the same, then I can use WordPress blocks without having to be always running behind them. So I think it could be a good thing for Drupal in particular, because they showed interest and in general, any content management system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally I said, open source projects, they could use this because I hope that will happen not really with components. So if you&#8217;re a React developer and you want to have a select dropdown, you don&#8217;t need to call it from scratch. You just go to NPM, to the registry and you can search, React dropdown or React select. And that will be like quite a few components that we can download. You can install and you can have in your application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a block, it&#8217;s also a component. It&#8217;s a high level component, which has a definite functionality and is trying to achieve a certain goal. So I can see that if that happened in the past with components, it will also happen in the future with blocks, that developers will create blocks, which can be used by anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of blocks like modifying like editing video or editing images. Or whatever it is really. Games, the could actually create games and published them on blocks as blocks. And then any website will embed them on their own, their own application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a really nice list. I can really see exactly what you&#8217;re talking about, especially the sort of time saving, labor saving aspects of this. You know, teams who have a modest budget who can just leverage things which have already been built and contributed out as open source blocks within this block protocol, it&#8217;d be really useful. And like you say, applications where the constraints of money or perhaps experience are going to cause it to be really difficult to get over the line. And if you can then just dip into a bunch of prebuilt blocks that other people have already committed, that would be brilliant. And like you say, content management systems and the one that you mentioned Drupal, who&#8217;ve gone out of their way to link with Gutenberg and make their own module so that they can use Gutenberg. Yeah. It&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that though, is about, it&#8217;s about the benefits, I guess, to people if WordPress were to adopt this. So this is about people gaining a benefit, but you go on to describe it in the opposite direction. You talk about the benefits to the WordPress project of the block protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to just explain your reasoning behind that? Who, well not who, what are the benefits? What are the benefits that will be brought to WordPress as a whole by the block protocol?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> All right. The first thing I believe is that WordPress will keep growing. And the reason for that is at WordPress right now, it&#8217;s used as a content management system. But if it also provides blocks, then developers can use WordPress on a different role, which is to create the layout, the client site for the applications. So then WordPress will become more entrenched in the toolkit for creating websites. And even though WordPress right now is really quite big, you know, Matt Mullenweg wants to be even bigger, right? Like, so I think that this is a potential outcome that will happen. That WordPress becomes the default tool to create sites. Not just content management system, as it may be the case that right now, but also to create layouts for even static sites, like HTML based sites that were created with JavaScript. Now you can use WordPress for that, which is something quite new. I mean, you&#8217;ll then think of WordPress to create static HTML sites via JavaScript. But this could be a possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then if this were to happen, the modern world of developers will come into WordPress, JavaScript developers, React, Vue, Angular. So they might want to become engaged and become contributors. So I was checking the Stack Overflow survey, and currently there are three times more JavaScript developers than PHP developers in the market. So then think about it. If you&#8217;re suddenly opening up the gates to these guys, you&#8217;re opening up to, potentially three times of many contributors as we have not right now. I mean, assuming a similar rate of contribution, of course, I mean, this is just pure guessing. But the fact that you&#8217;re opening the gates to them can only bring, either nothing happens or they come in and they contribute. So this is a potential good outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you could have blocks available from other parties that you can import into your WordPress site. So if you have an image editor that somebody hacked ready for their own application and they use a block protocol, you can embed it to your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other aspect is that the WordPress editor or Gutenberg does not live everywhere on the WordPress site. So right now, when you go to the WP admin, you&#8217;re interacting with Gutenberg. But in the WordPress site that you&#8217;re creating as a developer, you don&#8217;t have Gutenberg there. On the client side, on the site that the visitors are accessing, there&#8217;s no Gutenberg there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the implication of that is that it not so easy to create nice layouts or dynamic functionality, using React or using Vue or using whatever else. So power the website that your visitors are accessing. So if we had a block protocol, we could create this on a much simpler way because now Gutenberg will be talking to the WP admin or to the blocks, via the block protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the block protocol will be a single API to create websites, whether it is a WP admin, which is already going through Gutenberg, or on the public facing site, that if you&#8217;re good with React, you can create a React client that talks to the block protocol. And the block protocol will embed the blocks that you already have provided by WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you&#8217;re gaining from what you already have. The idea with this is that you have this set of blocks that they only have a limited use, which is only from within the WP admin. Now you will also make these blocks available to the site, to the public facing site. Some blocks, they make no sense because they are only for editing content in the WP admin. But think of a game, you can develop a block that is a game and you could embed it on the public facing site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then why not? You could. Or an audio player like, this podcast, you can create a block that is a podcast player and you embedded on the site and it&#8217;s something that is just one line of code. You just add the block and everything is already existing. So once again, either you gain or nothing happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I think that blocks could be helpful in that coming phase four Gutenberg phase three, which is still some time to go, possibly 2023. Which is going to be based on collaboration. They&#8217;ve yet to use the WordPress editor or to create Google docs like experience. To communicate with other people, to collaborate that you can edit the same document. And then you can add comments on the side and you can integrate the comments or suggestions. You leave feedback. So all of these is going to be the next phase of Gutenberg. As it is now, it can only happen in the WP admin. So if we had a block protocol, all of this could also be brought to the client side. Now, particularly because you will not need to log into the WP admin any more to collaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for instance, if I have a WordPress site, I don&#8217;t give access to random people. I just give access to my editors, or the writers, right. But what if I want to collect input from normal folks from visitors? Right now the only option that I have is comments, but that&#8217;s not integrated within the editing workflow. So if you had the block protocol, you could replicate the same workflow, editing workflow experience on the public facing site and allow visitors to give you feedback or collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one other aspect that I mentioned in the article is that you can simplify how you render blocks dynamically, because right now there is an issue that Gutenberg has, which is that you need to create the same logic twice, once in JavaScript to render the HTML, when you&#8217;re editing the content in the WordPress editor. And once in PHP, when you&#8217;re rendering on the client for the visitor, that&#8217;s the dynamic content. So that means that the same call has to be called twice in two different technologies. And for what I have seen in the GitHub issue that was bringing this up, not everyone is comfortable with the two languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be comfortable with JavaScript, but not with PHP, or you might become comfortable with PHP, and not with JavaScript. So this gives you the alternative to do it only in JavaScript, which is not ideal because, if you do it on PHP, then you can print it on the HTML already, which has better for SEO. But at least you have the possibility to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that were to happen, I believe that more React developers could also be engaged with WordPress because they don&#8217;t need to work with PHP anymore. They will be basically working React all the way. And it will still be a WordPress site, which is quite interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, I have one more issue, one more item to mention. Which is that you can bring in developments from outside. So as I was mentioning, I&#8217;m working with GraphQL myself and what happened with GraphQL is quite interesting, quite remarkable, that you have produced a huge ecosystem of clients and tools. Which is the couple from each other. They&#8217;re not collaborate. They&#8217;re not talking to each other,. But all of these tools, they can operate with each other because they all follow the same specification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one single case that is quite easy to follow is static documentation of the endpoints that you&#8217;re creating with Graph QL. I believe that the same can naturally happen if we use a block protocol, that some developer out there can create a tool to create static documentation of the blocks that then you can use to document the blocks for WordPress. And if that were the case, you don&#8217;t need to develop these in-house. So that means that the WordPress contributors, they can free up their time to do something that is specific to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do like the idea of people being able to access all of the pretty amazing stuff that&#8217;s been created by the WordPress community already. That seems to be really interesting. If this were to happen, all of that good stuff that&#8217;s been made would be available elsewhere and not bound distinctly to Gutenberg, but also the idea that you mentioned and somewhat counter-intuitive to me, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of having all of these blocks on the front end and the notion that you don&#8217;t need to be logged in. I guess, all sorts of complex things that are otherwise out of bounds at the moment suddenly become possible. And so as yet, unimagined scenarios potentially will become possible in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further down in your article, you&#8217;ve got a section where you have some nice diagrams which might be worth the listeners actually going to look at. The sections called, decoupling the WordPress editor from Gutenberg. And you make the point that at the moment, the block is bound directly to Gutenberg, you know, there&#8217;s an inextricable link between them. And they need to be decoupled. And the block protocol sits firmly in the middle. Is there a lot of work that would need to be done there in your estimation? Does that feel like a huge leap that would happen anytime soon, were this all be pushed forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:12] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> I think it&#8217;s going to be a bit difficult, yes. Not because it is difficult, but because the devil is in the details. You know, I believe this is something that you get completely right, or people will not use it. It has to be perfect. And until you get the level of perfectness, it can take five years, like it took with WordPress editor with full site editing, right? Now, I don&#8217;t think that they will take five years, but the idea that something so simple can still be quite difficult. I think that will be the case. Now, why do I say this? One thing is what I was saying is that WordPress right now only cares about WordPress, but once it connects with the book protocol, WordPress will need to care about the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it cannot do whatever it wants to do. It doesn&#8217;t have that freedom anymore. It will be constrained by rules. And the block protocol is not set yet. It&#8217;s a work in progress actually right now is also a draft. There&#8217;s no version one dot zero. So these guys are coming up with it. And the best way that you have to come up with it, I guess if I have in a real use case example, right. So I don&#8217;t think they have anything on this sort of, because it is still the idea. So you develop an application, they use the block protocol, you will find problems. Problems that had not foreseen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I want to say with this is, the idea is magnificent. The concept is great, but I believe that as they implement it, they will keep finding challenges to make it really usable for everyone in a way that it makes sense, also. You remember bootstrap, right? Like the CSS framework? When bootstrap came out, every single website that was using bootstrap looked the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can customize it. You have different colors. Fair enough, but all the websites use the same grid system of 12 columns, and you knew it was a bootstrap website. So for instance, one of the difficult things here will be, how do we use the block protocol to create blocks that allow you to create a website that is still personal, that is still unique. That doesn&#8217;t look like every other website out there. So everyone that wants to use the WordPress blocks, they don&#8217;t want to look like they&#8217;re using the WordPress blocks, possibly. They might not want to look cheap. I gave the example of Mailchimp before. Image if Mainchimp used the WordPress blocks and then Mailchimp looked like a WordPress site? It&#8217;s like, hey Mailchimp, come on. You are worth 10 billion USD, what&#8217;s going on with you? They have to have personality, and a lot of those things, they would be a bit difficult to come up with. Fine, you can have CSS on top of it, but the components that you have inside the block. So as we said before, a block is basically a component, high-level component that is loading other components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that is fixed inside of the block. If you want to have a different functionality, you will need to add it inside of the block. But you cannot add so much stuff because then the block will be bloated. So then it has to be lean, but you still want to have personality that you have to have a functionality that no other website has, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I want to say is let&#8217;s see, let&#8217;s see how well, it goes, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be easy, to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It feels like it might be a bit of an uphill struggle. We&#8217;d mentioned just before we pressed record on this podcast. To some extent, it brings to mind an XKCD cartoon. I will make sure to link to this in the show notes, but there&#8217;s a wonderful cartoon on XKCD where they say the situation is there are currently 14 competing standards. This is ridiculous. We need to develop a universal standard that everybody is covered by that sorts out all use cases. And then soon after that, it says, well, the actual situation after that is, there are now 15 competing standards. And I wonder if we revisited this conversation in a couple of years time, whether or not this would have taken time to move forward, because obviously, you know, the resources to create the Gutenberg project and to push it forward are very limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like you say, it took five years to do where we&#8217;ve got two so far and I suspect, if we were to rewind to five years ago, the expectation would be that it had gotten a little bit further by then. So I guess I&#8217;m just nervous that it might end up being a bit of a dead end possibly and end up consuming a lot of time. The devil, as you say, would be in the detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:51] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> I&#8217;m actually hopeful because I think the block protocol is a first attempt to make this. Now it is true, what you are saying XKCD that you have all of the different blocks implemented by different parties, but nobody&#8217;s trying to interact with any other block or any other application out there. So this is the first guy who is trying to say, let&#8217;s get all the blocks communicating. So in a way, it has credit. Okay, is it not so dire this situation yet? And I&#8217;m also quite hopeful because of what happened with Graph QL. That is a specification that, just by complying with the specification, great things may happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I want to say with this is that the block protocol, you develop it, you put it out there. And you let the community react and they might actually react in ways that you had not foreseen in advance. They can surprise you. You can actually create magic out of this, that you don&#8217;t need to coordinate different teams to work together. With the protocol you&#8217;re basically working together, and in this case, what you&#8217;re actually doing is having WordPress be used by the world outside of WordPress. And at the same time, you have WordPress being able to reach out to code that was not coded for WordPress. So the potential is so good that even though the path ahead may look broken it may look difficult, I think it&#8217;s utterly worth pursuing. It depends on the interest from the community. I don&#8217;t know if the community is interested to be honest. If you&#8217;re from WordPress, maybe there&#8217;s not so much for you to gain from this. If all you see is WordPress. If you will have WordPress now, and you only plan to use WordPress forever more. Yeah. Maybe there&#8217;s not so much for you. But, if you are open-minded of thinking, hey, unexpected things will happen from this. Then you can get really excited about this. I&#8217;m particularly excited myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Good. Yeah. That&#8217;s great. One of the things you mentioned a little while ago was the fact that at the moment, WordPress is kind of inward facing, you know, the Gutenberg, the output of Gutenburg and all of the things that are inside of Gutenberg. WordPress only needs to worry about WordPress. So, that&#8217;s kind of looking inside to what the project needs to achieve for its own goals of democratizing publishing. Do you feel that the fact that if it turned outwards and integrated with the block protocol and thereby had to obey the standards that that brought with it, are there any drawbacks to that? Are there any situations you can imagine where there would be a conflict of interests or things would become more difficult or more time consuming or just not done in a way that they&#8217;re done so far? That might cause things to stall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:31] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> I think the biggest drawback might be that the world out there doesn&#8217;t care about this. And you&#8217;re spending your energy. So invite them, to welcome them and nobody cares and nobody comes in and so it was a lot of wasted effort. Of course. I mean, that&#8217;s always the case with everything. Like whenever you do an open source project, people may show up or they might not. And therefore for you or the same. The thing is that you have to do it because you have a real use case, that if you&#8217;re going to do it, it&#8217;s because you know that you will benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is just a proposition that you think, okay, this looks good. Let&#8217;s try and invest a lot of energy to invite others to come in. And then the community out there, they&#8217;re like, yeah, I don&#8217;t care WordPress, and I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;m using right now. You know, they moved on to different technologies and you&#8217;re trying to convince others and they don&#8217;t care then. Yeah, I think that, that&#8217;s the biggest issue that if we&#8217;re going to do this, there has to be a clear cut use case for WordPress to benefit. Now I did try to say many, several use cases in there in my article, but of course, I mean I&#8217;m and dreaming of sorts. If you have an application that can reuse blocks across two different technologies, for instance, WordPress and something else and you already had that. So for instance, okay, you have a technology, a company like Stripe that they need to cater to different technologies, they cater to PHP and they cater to JavaScript, to Go and to everything else because they provide APIs to connect with them and they have an interface or they maybe have different applications powered by different technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they will certainly benefit. So we need to be sure that when we go for, forward with this idea, that we have a real use case that we wanted and that we&#8217;re not trying to impress all the time to somebody and then they don&#8217;t get excited. They don&#8217;t come in and, it was wasted effort. I think that&#8217;s the biggest potential drawback. Conflict of interest that you mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think so. I haven&#8217;t thought about it, but Matt Mullenweg way was to make the open web open, open, open. Just now, he created, he bought the Openverse. Yeah. Yeah. So you might actually think conflict of interest. Yeah. I&#8217;m sure he will have conflict of interest that doesn&#8217;t stop him. As in if he has to give something for free, that will compete with some paid commercial product, or there, he will do it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot think of a conflict of interest in this case, but I don&#8217;t think that that would be a reason enough to know to not do it. At least based on previous experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When we&#8217;re recording this, which is in March 2022, as far as I&#8217;m aware, there&#8217;s been no more public outpourings of whether this will go on. The debates, not debate, but the Twitter thread that was begun between Matt and Joel, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s been updated too much. Do you have any insight or is it exactly where we were a couple of weeks ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:36] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> Yeah, I don&#8217;t have any insight. I believe that we are where we were, yeah. I wrote the article on this Smashing in part to try to start this conversation with the community, and yeah, they need to take it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually, I keep checking the block protocol, the project on the website. They are still developing it, but once again, it&#8217;s still a draft. So you can expect this to take a long time, many months still. So this might actually be slow and it ,might be a slow and steady process. I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, so be it, if that&#8217;s the way it needs to be. Really really interesting project. You&#8217;ll find all of the links that we mentioned in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also talked about the fact that it would be nice to get this conversation begun. That&#8217;s why you wrote the piece. With that in mind, is there anywhere that you make yourself available? Perhaps a Twitter account or some email address or public facing website? Is there a particular place that you would like to mention where we could find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:39] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> Right. Yeah, my Twitter is my surname, which is Losoviz, and my personal website is leoloso dot com. And then my plugin is Graph QL dash API dot com. And then, yeah, basically I&#8217;m always around, and I like email, I&#8217;m not so, I&#8217;m not so big on social media myself. I don&#8217;t participate so much. You will not see me really on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you send an email to me, which you can do through my personal website, I will certainly reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much Leonardo for joining us on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:15] <strong>Leonardo Losoviz:</strong> Okay, thanks so much, Nathan.

It is a standalone block that allows users to accept donations almost instantly. No complicated setup. Just install, activate, connect to Stripe, and play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I named the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/\">GiveWP plugin</a> my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/reflecting-on-2019-the-year-in-review\">favorite of 2019</a>. The team behind the donation plugin has consistently produced top-tier plugins and extensions, and I have long been of fan of the company&#8217;s work. It did not take me long to install and activate its latest plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donation Form Block for Stripe is essentially a lite version of GiveWP. The primary product is far more powerful and has an entire ecosystem of extensions built around it. In general, it is geared more toward charities, non-profits, and other fundraising efforts where users might need more flexibility, reporting, and integration with third-party systems. It can be overkill for someone who merely needs a simple donation form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-off donation form block is better-suited for those &#8220;buy me a coffee&#8221; scenarios than well-organized fundraisers. I am glad to see GiveWP tackling this side of the donation arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inserting the block is as easy as adding any other. However, before using it, users should connect their Stripe account, and the plugin provides a handy button for doing so in the block sidebar:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Connecting to Stripe.\n\n\n\n<p>The Stripe connection persists, so it only needs to be configured once. From that point, everything is relatively straightforward. Plug in a few details and publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a couple of minutes, I had created and published a fictional fundraiser for cleaning a local basketball court.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Full donation form on the front end.\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I love the idea of this block, I was not entirely happy with the user experience. However, keeping in mind that this is version 1.0.x, it has a ton of potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GiveWP&#8217;s donation form managed to break nearly every one of my block-related cardinal sins while still managing to be an exceptional product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users must add an image, custom text, and donation field text via the block options sidebar. This means there is no Rich Text input, so users cannot even add simple bold and italic styles. It also feels unintuitive working from the sidebar instead of modifying the fields directly from the content canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Text editing in the sidebar instead of the block in the content canvas.\n\n\n\n<p>A more ideal approach would have used the &#8220;inner blocks&#8221; feature to put Heading, Paragraph, and Image/Cover blocks &#8212; locked in place &#8212; into the main donation form. It could have done the same with the buttons and other form elements via custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, most of the problems are related to control over the design. One of the worst things block plugins can do is overrule everything the theme styles on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not get me wrong; blocks should ensure quality control over their own output. Their functionality should be unencumbered, and their layout should work well regardless of the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this donation block takes its duties a step too far, using JavaScript to inject CSS into the page and doubling up on the specificity with <code>!important</code>. Even if a theme <em>wanted</em> to integrate with the block, it is next to impossible to style the donation form elements. <em>Is there really any reason that the inputs are required to have 2px, solid, rounded borders?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And, why are my theme and user-registered colors not even available for the single color option provided?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme colors not selectable.\n\n\n\n<p>That is what frustrates me the most &#8212; not just with this block. WordPress has built this standardized system that allows communication between the platform, plugins, themes, and end-users. It lets developers build output that should always be customizable. By no means does it cover every aspect of design. However, the foundational components are in place. Colors and font sizes have been around for over three years. Extended typography and border controls are available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no way to make a wide or full-width form. The block does not support alignments, and even when wrapping a Group block, the plugin limits it to a maximum width of 650 pixels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these problems are similar to the issues I was writing about nearly two years ago with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/givewp-2-7-adds-donation-form-templates-and-per-form-stripe-connections\">release of GiveWP 2.7</a>. I would have liked to have seen them addressed on an entirely new plugin release from the outset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite my complaints, the plugin does the one thing it must do correctly, at least as good as anyone and better than most. It makes accepting donations as simple as inserting a block into a page, customizing a handful of fields, and hitting the publish button. If the dev team never added another enhancement, that would be all most of its users need.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/donation-block-for-stripe-by-givewp/\">Donation Form Block for Stripe</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 03:15:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"HeroPress: Connection Makes Credibility, Credibility Makes Opportunity – 連結產生信賴，信賴創造機會\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4407\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:190:\"https://heropress.com/essays/connection-makes-credibility-credibility-makes-opportunity/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=connection-makes-credibility-credibility-makes-opportunity\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9682:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/031522-3-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Being connected to meetups is the most valuable part of the WordPress community. 在小聚中與人建立連結，是參加小聚最有價值的地方。\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#chinese\">這篇文章同時有繁體中文版本。」</a></p>\n<p>I’m Huanyi Chuang (Eric) from Taiwan. I’ve been participating in the WordPress community for several years. Of course, this experience isn’t long compared with other people’s experiences in the open-source communities. Still, I have learned a lot by joining this fantastic group and am eager to share my experience.</p>\n<h2>Why I Started</h2>\n<p>I started joining Taipei meetup because I tried to seek solutions to my client’s website issues. For people who haven’t been to any meetups, a WordPress meetup is somewhere you can meet experienced WordPress users or developers to help you with your questions.</p>\n<p>When I encountered an issue with the custom archive pages, a local meetup announcement showed on my WordPress dashboard. And that was my original connection with the local community, not impressive, but true.</p>\n<h2>Why I Keep Participating</h2>\n<p>In the end, the WordPress community gives me the chance to connect with people.</p>\n<p>At first, I started by asking questions, and I found that I might find some leads in the meetups and wanted to take advantage by knowing more potential clients. So I brought my business cards to every event from then on.</p>\n<p>That didn’t work well, as I didn’t acquire any clients from attendees.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of reasons why that didn’t work, but the main reason is credibility and sincerity. I wanted to “get” rather than “give.” It sounds cliché, but people do feel.</p>\n<p>So I questioned myself, “why do I even bother staying here?”</p>\n<p>“Make some friends, you silly,” said the voice in my mind.</p>\n<p>I started to focus more on making new friends and listening more to people. I also started to share my own experience of website management as a meetup speaker.</p>\n<p>And then, the first WordCamp Taipei was born in 2018.</p>\n<p>I joined as an organizer, working on session planning and speakers contact. In the organizing phase, I met new friends from different fields and foreign countries, which gave me a great sense of achievement and strengthened my passion for participating in the community.</p>\n<h2>“Start Your Meetup”</h2>\n<p>Akihiro Nishino, a famous Japanese comedy actor, states that “information only goes for those who take actions.” And that’s what I benefit from the meetups.</p>\n<p>After the first WordCamp, the local communities seemed more visible, and more volunteers wanted to start their meetups. The organizer of the Taipei meetup asked me, “you told me that you want to start the meetup in Taoyuan. Would you like to start it with a partner?” and referred me to another organizer.</p>\n<p>“Of course,” said I.</p>\n<p>We started our local community in Taoyuan. The number of people was far less than Taipei’s, but we found our own pace. We create a pattern of “multiple organizers,” which diversified the pressure of a single organizer, as there are always “minimum attendees,” who are ourselves. The organizers in Taoyuan then became a group of close friends, who often have an “after meetup” after a regular one, grabbing drinks or gourmet together.</p>\n<p>Being connected tofrom meetups is the most valuable part of the community. Having these friends makes me gather more information. We share information and benefit from others’ information, and thus we gain more trust in each other. With such credibility, we share more deeply and build deeper relations.</p>\n<h2>Summary: Why You Should Join</h2>\n<p>To be honest, the main reason you should join the WordPress community is that you can benefit from it no matter what positions you take.</p>\n<p>As an attendee, you come and ask for answers. As a speaker, you come to validate your discovery and share your ideas to build your credibility. Finally, as an organizer, you make everyone feel safe to share and ask questions to attract more people to join and follow the community.</p>\n<p>If you participate in the community long enough, you may also discover the humanity behind the community: people may have reasons to start joining WordPress communities. However, what keeps them participating continuously remains the same: they found the value to do so. Most people leave because their initial needs disappear; either they have found their solutions or found someone else for their issues, which is still great, as we create an environment to help them out. However, not until you keep participating, will you find more you can achieve than you expect.</p>\n<p>Here is my own story about my experience in the WordPress community, and I hope that this may encourage more people to join this organic community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chinese\">連結產生信賴，信賴創造機會</h1>\n<p>大家好，我是 Eric。我已經持續參與了 WordPress 社群幾年的時間。當然，相較於其他人，這樣的經歷並不特別，但我希望仍然可以透過這篇分享，和大家聊聊這些年我所見所學的點點滴滴。</p>\n<h2>為什麼我開始參與小聚</h2>\n<p>起初，我因為抱著想要解決客戶網站問題的心情，參與了第一場台北小聚。在這裡跟沒有參加過小聚的人說明一下，WordPress 小聚是個你可以與有經驗的 WordPress 使用者或開發者共享交流、取得協助的場合。</p>\n<p>當時的我遇到了一些客製化的難關，在 WordPress 的控制台首頁出現了小聚的通知，那便是我第一次參與小聚的經歷。並不戲劇化，但是我相信這也是開啟許多人參與小聚的契機。</p>\n<h2>為什麼持續參與</h2>\n<p>原因很簡單，因為小聚讓我可以與不同的人產生連結。</p>\n<p>起初，我只是為了詢問問題，接著我開始想「說不定可以在這裡遇到潛在的客戶」，並且開始琢磨著如何接洽新的生意，因此後來幾次小聚，我都是帶著名片在身上的。</p>\n<p>但是這樣做其實並沒有什麼效果，我並沒有因為帶了名片就取得任何新客。</p>\n<p>這個結果可能有許多原因，不過我總結來看，認為原因不外乎兩個：信賴度與真誠。在這樣的過程中，我只想要「獲得」而非「給予」，雖然這樣講有點老掉牙，但這種幽微的氣息差異，其他人都能感受得到。</p>\n<p>於是我回頭思考，「為什麼我還要來？」</p>\n<p>「當然是交朋友啊，傻子。」我心中的聲音跟我說。</p>\n<p>我開始更專注在交朋友這件事上，並花更多時間在聽別人說話，畢竟開始工作後，並沒有太多機會認識新朋友。同時，我也開始分享自己管理網站的經驗。</p>\n<p>接著，台灣的第一場 WordCamp－WordCamp Taipei 2018 誕生了。</p>\n<p>在這之中，我參與了議程組的籌備。在過程中，我與不同國籍的講者、不同領域的志工接觸，得到了莫大的成就感，並且透過這樣的「連結」，加深了自己持續參與社群事務的熱情。</p>\n<h2>「開始你的小聚」</h2>\n<p>日本著名的喜劇演員，西野亮廣曾提到「資訊會集中在那些採取行動的人身上」，而這句話正凸顯了我在小聚中獲益的地方。</p>\n<p>在 WordCamp 結束後，在地社群的能見度更高了，而更多的志工也希望開始他們自己的小聚。台北小聚的阿竣問了：「你之前說想在桃園辦小聚，要不要試著跟其他人一起舉辦呢？」並引薦了當初的另一位主辦給我。</p>\n<p>「好啊！」我說。</p>\n<p>我們開始了在桃園的地區小聚。參加的人數上，遠遠不及台北小聚，但我們也找到了我們自己的步調。我們採取了「多主辦」的模式，分散了一個主辦可能會需要面對的壓力——至少，我們就是「參加者」。桃園小聚的主辦們後來慢慢成為關係不錯的一群朋友，我們也常常邀著每次小聚的會眾參加「續攤」的行程，一起吃吃喝喝。</p>\n<p>從小聚中建立連結，對我來說一直都是社群最重要的部分，從這些朋友身上我也了解更多不同領域的資訊，而隨著這些資訊的交流，我們也建立了更多的信任與更緊密的連結。</p>\n<h2>結語：為什麼值得你參加</h2>\n<p>坦白說，不論你在這個社群中站在什麼樣的位置，你都能從社群得益。</p>\n<p>身為參與者，你可以來到小聚，並尋求解答；身為講者，你可以到小聚驗證你的發現，以及透過分享你的想法，建立你的可信度；身為主辦，你可以透過營造一個安全、舒適的交流環境，吸引更多的人參與社群、分享資訊。</p>\n<p>如果你參加了夠長的一段時間，你也可以發現在社群後面的人性：參與社團的人原因百百種，但是持續參與的原因只有一種：發現了社群的價值。這些人十分稀少，大多數的人離開，是因為一開始的問題得到解決了，或是找到了可以幫他們解決問題的人，這也都是好事，因為我們創造了幫助他們的機會。然而，只有持續參與，才能再更進一步發現，你能夠取得的成就，將會比預期的更多。</p>\n<p>這是我自己參與 WordPress 社群的故事，希望這個故事，也能夠激起你對於參與這個社群有不一樣的想法。</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Huanyi (Eric) Chuang\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"WPTavern: DigitalOcean Acquires CSS-Tricks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=131462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wptavern.com/digitalocean-acquires-css-tricks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4611:\"<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS-Tricks</a> has been <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-tricks-is-joining-digitalocean/\">acquired by DigitalOcean</a>, a cloud hosting provider popular among developers.

Lance believes employers need to think about how they market themselves to prospective employees. Traditional approaches to hiring won\'t work with the next generation of job seekers. What if open source values and ways of thinking point to solutions WordPress businesses can uniquely embrace? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lance will be speaking at the upcoming <a href=\"https://wpcareersummit.com/\">WP Career Summit</a> on April 8th, 2022.

Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I was there, but I was a ghost</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> just, it\'s huge. Um, so yeah, a little bit of, a little bit of WordCamp attendance looking forward to Europe this year. Yeah. And I\'m. Connected to the WordPress community through XWP. And I get to meet lots of really cool people from all over WordPress, you know, um, you know, leading the recruiting and hiring over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of chances to learn, learn a lot about, you know, what WordPress is doing and in community-wise like in different spots all around the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> How long have you been with, um, your ex</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> WP? Uh, since 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> And what\'s your, what\'s your job title?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah, a recruitment lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So XWP has a recruitment department.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many people is it? Is it just you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Um, it\'s it\'s me and one other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yeah, that\'s incredible. How many people currently work at, uh, the company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Uh, we\'re just right at 122. That\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I keep forgetting. You folks with that big,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> uh, it\'s, it\'s pretty a recent development, right? We went in the last, um, what, 14 months or so from 40 to 120.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we had a very, very busy year. Um, last, last calendar year, growing the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What do you think we\'re going to get into you are a speaker at the upcoming WP career summit. That\'s happening on April 8th. We\'re going to get to that in a second, but first I wanted to get, since you are into recruitment, I wanted to get your overall thoughts on what the status or what the state of hiring and WordPress is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do you think the WordPress ecosystem lies currently in terms of looking for technical?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah, that\'s a good question. And I mean, I can speak to my observations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Yes, please. That\'s you are, you are made for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah. Well, I don\'t know how authoritative it really is. Right. But from what I, from what I see, it seems that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, particularly folks with a good bit of experience and exposure to, you know, relatively compact complex projects are in incredibly high demand, um, and are pretty well taking their pick. And at least folks that I\'m talking to are typically having more than one offer coming across their desk. Um, at the same time we might be making an offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s, it\'s quite competitive and, um, You know, especially in terms of technology focused roles, you know, engineering, um, design, even though design is often less WordPress specific, um, uh, design UI design and UX design, uh, is incredibly high demand right now. Um, strategic product work, product owners, product managers are also in very high demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and as far as it relates to work, press. I mean, so long as word press continues to grow and continues to be seen as a viable solution for more and more complex projects and problems to solve. Um, I don\'t, I don\'t think it\'s slowing down at all. At least we don\'t see it slowing down on our side. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So you are actually, you\'re giving me giving a talk on the, um, at the career summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your title is the future of hiring is marketing. Can you summarize the gist of. Because you\'re the one giving the talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah. I\'ll give you some of my thoughts around why I\'m going with a title like this. And what I\'m thinking about here is that, um, well, a couple of things for one, um, I think about an opportunity, you know, at a company that I represent as a product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I want to represent that product in the best way possible and in an accurate way. Right. So we need to have a good product and we need to, uh, really. Represented well, and talk about it and give people insight into, into what\'s here, because I think people will like the product, but maybe they just don\'t know about it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thinking</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> you\'re going to like working for us. You just don\'t know it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> That\'s right. And, you know, so much of the, of the recruitment industry is incredibly reaction driven. Right? All of a sudden we have a need, we\'ve got to fill it right now, get out there, uh, knock on doors, you know, send those messages, do the outbound work, you know, track someone down and get them in the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so long as hiring is this reactive experience. Um, it\'s going to be. A poor experience for candidates, it\'s going to be stressful and it\'s going to result in probably not the best fit and long-term tenure for team members. But if you can think in terms of a long-term strategic arc for a company that has a great product, um, you want to be building interest, you know, building content, building this magnet that attracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, buyers for that product. And so I think about it the same way. If, if a candidate, if a software engineer or project manager or designer, you know, is the buyer that we\'re trying to reach, what kind of content matters to them? You know, how are we talking about the product, the opportunity here in a way that, Hey, somebody might actually be interested, um, without us having to harass them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On their LinkedIn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So how do you, we\'ll get to LinkedIn in a second. I want to ask you about that, but how do you put that into a, a digital physical form? Is that in terms of blog posts or, I mean, how do you, how do you make something more welcome to the people that you\'re trying to attract now? You think you will track down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Um, I think there\'s, uh, several different channels that we should be looking at. And this is something we\'ll get into more specifically when we get to the, when we get to the talk. But as you know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> and just, you can just give me one, this is a preview. I don\'t need your whole talk here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah. Right. I don\'t want to fill up the fill up the whole time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What\'s your, what, what, what you think is the one that maybe gets most overlooked or the most underappreciated?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Hmm. That\'s a good question. Uh, the most under appreciated might be social proof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> What do you mean by social?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> I mean, um, the times when somebody who already works at your company says, Hey, you know, this is such a great place to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love it. Um, you, whether that\'s on their social media or on a reviews site, something like a class door, um, or, you know, Testimonials basically. Yeah. Testimonials, right. It\'s super organic. And it reaches not just the network that your company reaches, but it reaches the network that these individuals reach as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so I think that\'s under appreciated and I think if organizations will nurture that kind of thing, um, you know, not, uh, not a forced thing, obviously you want that to be organic and natural, but if you can nurture, um, that. Norm for how people engage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Um, I don\'t know. I don\'t know normal about how people engage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m still trying to figure that out myself, but I think, I think I get what you mean. Let me ask you the obvious question. How did you get recruited for XWP? How did you get in there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah, that\'s uh, that\'s um, that\'s what I\'m still trying to figure out. What am I doing here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> I took a glass of wine. I woke up here and I just started working for \'em.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah. So I actually have a, I started my career in forestry of all things. I worked, um, running a reforestation business, um, and it was, you know, based in the Southeastern us. Um, we had tree planting crews that were covering all over the Southeastern us. And, uh, it was, it was like intense project management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I got connected with Arland birds, our chief people officer over there, uh, And it was probably a two year conversation. Wow. To the point where, where we first started kicking the idea around, um, to me actually joining XWP, um, in a shared, uh, people ops and project management capacity in 2017. Um, I didn\'t know anything about software then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\'t know anything about WordPress and I didn\'t know anything about. Uh, a remote company. I just knew that I wanted more flexibility and I was willing to work hard and learn. And I was excited about, you know, the culture that I was seeing there. And yeah, it\'s been, it\'s been a fantastic journey, you know, from there to here</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Is two years, a typical time to have a conversation like that when the end result is coming to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> I don\'t think that\'s typical, but I think it\'s good to keep in mind that the people that are saying no, not right now. Are potentially two years down the road, the people that are going to be saying, yeah, the time is right. So you need to be creating this experience. That\'s warm and welcoming. Um, and if you take the attitude of, if they\'re say no, not right now, I don\'t have time for that conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be losing out on an incredible team member like me. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You really do know how to sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me, uh, w what specific, what\'s specific about WordPress, in your opinion, um, versus any other technology or any other attract. Um, is there something unique about WordPress that, um, that from a community standpoint or anything that makes the people that XWP is looking for a specialty attractive versus some, maybe another language or another industry in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah, so, like I said, coming in, in 2017, not knowing that much about WordPress or software communities, the thing that is just really stood out to me is the openness and. You\'re just boiling it down to the open source nature of both the technology and the community, I think is just, is really astounding coming from a world where everything is proprietary and, you know, you guard your secrets and you, you know, you do everything you can to get a one-up this, this idea of, of opening things and sharing and rooting for someone else, you know, because if they succeed, you succeed, um, it\'s just an incredible set of values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That resonates with me really strongly. And, you know, seeing folks at XVP who also resonate with our values of teamwork and giving and mastery of craft, um, you know, they\'re, those things are just woven so much into the fabric of the WordPress community, especially in terms of people who are. Leading releases and contributing to the core technology of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, it\'s just a really strong match there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> You can literally sit down. Well, this was before COVID anyway, but hopefully coming it\'s coming soon. You could literally sit down at a table with somebody from a competitor and work on the same, um, for on contributor day, work on the same project together in the open source context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. You know, there there\'s not rivals there there\'s just contributors. And even if it wasn\'t away from the table, I mean, we see people mix WordCamps all the time. Like you said, there was that openness, but with WordPress open source, but I think a lot with the WordPress openness in terms of you don\'t even have to be necessarily a developer, you can be, um, you know, a marketer or someone who\'s brand new and they have a lot of times be able to mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you may have a market or talk to a developer and it\'s that cross-pollination of, you know, you don\'t have to be communicating with developers to attract or make your company seem open and welcome. You know, it\'s all about networking that marketer may have a developer friend that\'s looking for a new home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually. You never know, you know, you plant the seed, you know, you never know where it\'s going to grow. Let\'s get back to LinkedIn for a second. I don\'t use LinkedIn very much. How, how important is LinkedIn? Um, for the, for the average developer may be someone who\'s maybe not using it or maybe someone who\'s currently right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, maybe a freelancer. What\'s your view on that? Is it creepy? Is it, is it effective? Is it somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> I know there\'s a lot of different opinions here on LinkedIn, but for me, I think it\'s a really useful tool, right? So, um, especially if somebody is a freelancer or they\'re, you know, trying to get their development career up and going, and there\'s in the early years of it, the networking opportunity there is really large.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and if you want to be found by a recruiter, Then that\'s a great place because they\'ll find you yeah. That\'s stopped. Number one. Right. So if you don\'t want to be found by a recruiter, then, you know, well, don\'t spend your time there. Right. So it just depends on the goals of your career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So, and your position though, your position you\'re looking for work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the number? What is the, what\'s a good way for people who are looking for hires, how do they most effectively use LinkedIn?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Um, yeah, so LinkedIn has a lot of search functionality. So, you know, going through. You know, first at the first stop, right. Who is a WordPress developer. Right. So I can filter that down and filter things down to reasonable batch of people to, to, to look through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And then you\'re looking through more specific things, you know, who seems like a good fit for our organization who has particular. You have technical skillsets. Um, then you can create a batch there of people that you\'d like to reach out to. And, you know, that\'s the, that\'s the outbound strategy for most recruiters when it comes to LinkedIn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other side of that, which ties into, you know, the topic of my, uh, my, my talk for the career summit is that as a recruiter, um, LinkedIn is, should not only be an outbound tool. You should be whether you are the recruiter in our organization, or you\'re the founder of an organization. If it\'s a smaller organization, but you need to hire, this is where you start conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re by posting thought leadership type content, or even just engaging in comment threads the same way that you might in Twitter. Right? You didn\'t have to be the one to post it, but you can add valuable input to a conversation, you know, by commenting on that. Um, and I mean, it\'s just like any other social network where you\'re the more active you are, the more it will reward you, uh, in terms of growing your network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you are visible, You know, somebody who has a freelance career in mind finishes their, their contract and just thinking, Hmm. You know, what\'s next for me? You know, if they\'ve been seen, you know, you, David talking about the cool things you\'re doing at an Vajra gallery, you know, every week they\'re thinking, Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if there\'s an opportunity there and that\'s a place where that they might reach to you. So, um, it\'s a two way thing and a lot of, a lot of recruiting only sees. As this is my way to find people and send them messages. Um, but treat it as a marketing tool. Just the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> So what, how does this, as we begin to wrap things up here, a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does company culture fit into marketing? I\'ve seen company culture in good context and bad contexts unintentionally a lot of times, how does that factor in, into the recruiting process? Um, part of the marketing and if so, what can recruiters, what should recruiters be careful of or which are they keeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah, I love that. I love this question. Um, there\'s a phrase that I\'ve coined and I don\'t know that I like the exact wording on this year, but the concept is that, you know, people often say that culture or not culture content is king. Right. So it\'s all about putting content out there. And I\'ve suggested recently that culture is king content is the town crier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Okay. Well, I got my quote for the episode anyway. Now it\'s worth it. Say that again, though, just to make sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> So rather than content being king culture is king content is the town crier. And so if you, if you don\'t have a culture worth talking about this whole strategy, um, isn\'t going to do a lot of good because people want to come to an organization to be part of the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where they can be excited about fitting in. They aligned with the values. They align with the type of work that you\'re doing, the impact that you\'re trying to make as an organization. So if you don\'t have anything good in that department to talk about a marketing strategy around hiring, it\'s going to be really difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the only thing you can talk about is dollars or benefits or office perks or things like this. Right. Um, so your, your question about how does culture fit in, um, at one. Culture is the source of all the marketing content that you should be thinking about as someone who\'s trying to drive hiring. So recently we created at XVP a, um, a blog post that outlines in detailed transparently, what our hiring process is like, what steps you can expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basically we\'re pulling back the curtain of like, we, we designed the process. For hiring it, it wraps around our core values and our culture and X WP. And this is what it looks like. If you get involved, this is what you can expect. Um, so rather than trying to keep that as a proprietary secret thing, uh, to create surprises for candidates, for, you know, keep our competitors from borrowing our ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we just sold, you know, we bought into the open source nature of the community that we serve. And said, here\'s everything that we do. Um, so that she, that\'s, that\'s a way for us to share, you know, what it looks like inside and then a candidate or job seeker, or maybe not even a job seeker, right. Somebody who\'s got a skillset and an experience that would do really well here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They might see that and say, oh, that\'s interesting. And it begins to build interest towards X WP. Or whatever, you know, organization that you\'re creating this content for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Hm. And speaking of XWP, I thought it would be appropriate since you are sharing your valuable time with me. Um, what would be, if I want, if someone came up to you and said, tell me, um, tell me in a few sentences, what?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, cause I\'ll reedit this. I thought it would be appropriate. As we close this out to give you the opportunity glance to S to share, uh, what is your brief sales pitch in terms of X WP, the company, what would you think sets it apart? And this is educational because someone outside of XWP will listen to this and go, Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may use that. Right. Or change that, but what, what\'s your elevator pitch in terms of XWP?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah. Okay. Well, here\'s my, here\'s my pass at that. Um, it\'s a few things. First of all, we have a very inclusive and flexible remote work environment. Ooh, sorry. So that resonated with somebody. I hope so in flexible, remote work environment, um, we\'ve been doing much like many of the organizations in the WordPress community, but we\'ve been remote since day one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significantly before COVID began. Um, so this is built in to the fabric, the DNA of, of how we operate as an organization. Um, uh, so that\'s, that\'s, that\'s, that\'s one element. Um, second, very interesting and challenging projects to work on. So the, the, the work that\'s coming your way is not likely to be the same repetitive task or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s just reusing what you\'ve learned to. Um, the, the types of projects that we\'re working with are usually pushing something for each of our team members. And that\'s something that people often give feedback on being something that\'s really important to them. Um, and we\'re a very people first culture as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, we are, we invest heavily into the experience of being an employer or being a member of X to VP community. Um, Several things that we do, that a lot of organizations, you know, would like to do, but maybe they don\'t, but you know, what we\'re doing here is really saying that, um, we, we value each individual and, uh, we\'re willing to put the money where the mouth is in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset:</strong> Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You guys have a big, I was just gonna say big mouth, but that didn\'t come out. Right. Well, Lance speaking of big mouse, I\'m going to shut mine. I really appreciate the time you spent here today. And I\'m looking forward to listening to your talk. The, again, it is the, um, the talk you\'re giving us the future of hiring is marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re giving it at the WP career summit, April 8th, the events happening between nine and five central time. So that\'s think that\'s 10 to six. And then everyone else will be able to pull out their calculators and figure it out for themselves. Um, and I, and it\'s a really, it\'s a really good conference too, because it\'s both for job seekers and hiring managers, and I\'ve spoken to a lot of people about tips for those seeking jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I really appreciated your tips today on kind of like the other side of the coin behind the curtain, the, how do the, how do companies attract. And like you said, it\'s not just throwing out, you know, they should hopefully throw out salary ranges. Um, but you know, it\'s not just the perks in the salary ranges, but there\'s, there\'s a lot of other things that go into it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s not just posting things on job boards. So thanks for giving me some insight on that and seeing how the other side works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lance Robbins:</strong> Yeah, my pleasure. Thanks so much for the invite to be here. I\'m really excited about the WP career summit. Really happy that Post Status is doing something like this. Um, great, great to be a part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re looking forward to it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 21:19:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"David Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: The Dream of Exporting WordPress Block Themes from the Site Editor Is Close to Reality\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=131433\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/the-dream-of-exporting-wordpress-block-themes-from-the-site-editor-is-close-to-reality\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5387:\"<p>I have said it before, but it bears repeating: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-next-generation-of-wordpress-theme-authors-will-design-from-the-site-editor\">the next generation of WordPress theme authors will design from the site editor</a>. It seems that Gutenberg project contributors are making good on my promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier today, I exported a WordPress theme from the site editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Exporting the Twenty Twenty-Two theme.\n\n\n\n<p>The resulting ZIP file seemed to include all the necessary bits to upload and activate like any other theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a feature that I had been waiting on for months. It is a significant step toward the idea of not only democratizing publishing but bringing that same philosophy to website design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hesitated for only a moment to check the ZIP for anything that might need adjusting. I renamed the inner folder and the <code>Theme Name</code> header in <code>style.css</code>. Then, I dropped it into <code>/wp-content/themes</code>. The moment of truth was upon me as I tapped the Activate button from the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No fatal errors. <em>Whew.</em> Activation was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was by no means perfect. It felt much like climbing that first hill in programming where you move from concept to a broken-but-somewhat-working implementation. It is often the roughest hill in the journey, but you just keep moving once you get to the top. The hard work will be worth it in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested exporting Twenty Twenty-Two via <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/#nightly\">Gutenberg Nightly</a>. After checking the front end and the site editor, I noticed that some pieces were not there:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Exported Twenty Twenty-Two in the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The bundle was missing a boatload of files, but this was expected behavior. As of WordPress 5.9, users can download their templates and template parts. Two recent enhancements to the development version of the Gutenberg plugin adds more theme files to the mix:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39048\">Add <code>theme.json</code> to export file</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27528\">Add <code>index.php</code> and <code>style.css</code></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is almost surprising that the &#8220;TT2 Export&#8221; theme I uploaded resembled Twenty Twenty-Two at all. It had none of the PHP files for adding features like custom patterns. Even the <code>style.css</code> file, while included, was not loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this shows how powerful <code>theme.json</code> has become. It was still a functioning theme without all the other pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is merely the first step. One of the next tickets in line, if approved, will [maybe] <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39202\">export the entire theme contents</a>. Like its predecessors, it has its own kinks. Such an export presents challenges when the theme has anything beyond the standard features. This can be anything from class/function naming to autoloading to missing scripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest code from the pull request will ignore <code>.git</code>, <code>vendor</code>, and <code>node_modules</code> directories in exports. This could change how some creators build themes altogether, particularly as the system continues evolving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, we discussed <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/does-wordpress-need-1000s-of-block-themes-in-the-era-of-full-site-editing\">whether 1,000s of block themes were necessary</a>. The idea stemmed from a goal set by project co-founder Matt Mullenweg in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2021-wordpress-passes-43-market-share-looks-to-expand-the-commons-through-openverse\">2021 State of the Word</a>, where he said that the directory would have 300 or, ideally, 3,000. This was after mentioning 5,000 earlier in the address when referencing the then-28.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, WordPress has adopted a more official <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-ramps-up-social-learning-events-on-full-site-editing-project-aims-for-500-block-themes-in-2022\">goal of 500 themes</a> in the directory for 2022. That feels ambitious enough to be challenging but not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways to achieve it and those loftier numbers is to hand the keys to the design kingdom over to literally everyone. Well, anyone with access to the Appearance &gt; Editor admin screen in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a fully-featured theme exporter lands in WordPress this year, it could birth that next generation of creators the project needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another ticket proposes that the site editor <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39194\">overwrite template files</a> directly in the theme when a &#8220;developer mode&#8221; is enabled. This could help current theme developers transition to building more block themes. Exporting templates in a ZIP file is not part of the typical theme designer&#8217;s workflow. Nor is copying block code from the editor to paste into files. Having WordPress write template files to the system would cut out some of the dirty work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would rather have the latter feature before theme exports.

Discussions about the best way to do this have been happening for the past two years and now are gaining some momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Right now it&#8217;s possible to add video backgrounds, colored overlays, etc, to the Cover block alone,&#8221; Matias Ventura said in 2019 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16479\">ticket</a> on the UI for background tools. &#8220;It would make sense to extract this and extend to other container blocks (group and columns, for example) as well as expanding the features.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributor Andrew Serong has created a draft <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39243\">exploratory PR</a> for adding opt-in, server-rendered background support for blocks, which would save background image values to the block&#8217;s <code>style</code> attribute in a <code>backgroundImage</code> key. Serong created the PR as a rough, experimental approach and published a few screenshots of how the inspector controls might fit in. However, Gutenberg designers are working on a more refined design for background support in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Gutenberg designers Joen Asmussen and Javier Arce published a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39427\">GitHub issue</a> with their vision for a complete reorganization of background controls that includes layer management, layer reordering, and support for filters/blend modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The core idea is to group all the layers (both overlays and media layer) inside a single sidebar section called Background, abstracting the organization of the Cover Block layers on the canvas and simplifying the block sidebar,&#8221; Arce said.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These new designs intersect with the goal of expanding background support for use in other blocks beyond the Cover block. There are many other considerations that splinter out of adding background image support to blocks, which contributors have noted in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/38119\">discussions</a>. These include features like the ability to add a body background image to block themes, specify a color palette to be used for background colors, and the ability to add multiple background images.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding background image support and refining the UI for background controls is still a little ways off, but the project is starting to make significant steps  forward. This will be an exciting addition that will markedly expand users&#8217; ability to customize blocks.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 20:12:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"Gutenberg Times: WordPress 6.0, Four Types of Themes,  Museum of Block Art – Weekend Edition #206\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=20672\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordpress-6-0-four-types-of-themes-museum-of-block-art-weekend-edition-206/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11509:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we are back in Sarasota, Florida and back to our &#8216;two-litude&#8217; routine in our home.

In 2019, Rich Tabor <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/the-future-of-wordpress-themes/\">proposed adding a base theme</a> to WordPress itself, one upon which others would be built, if at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even that was not the first time someone had pondered similar one-theme utopias throughout the platform&#8217;s history. Many framework-style parent themes have all made a run for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us assume for a moment that WordPress has reached a state where all themes no longer need custom PHP and CSS code. We are nowhere near that point yet, but we can imagine such a day might be possible in the relatively distant future. In this ideal world, templating, styling, theme-supported features, and plugin integration are neatly packaged into something configurable from the admin. In practice, users could control any aspect of their site&#8217;s front-end through the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that someone still needs to make those customizations, and not everyone has a knack for design. One person&#8217;s ability does not automatically translate to all other users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps a more crucial point is that not everyone wants to customize their site&#8217;s design. Some people simply want to find something that suits their style and move along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are alternative routes for arriving at the same destination, but themes are currently the only reliable vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schutzsmith <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schutzsmith/status/1502417086106292226\">tweeted the following</a> in response to Jamie Marsland, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1502401847138697221\">likened the notion</a> to asking Picasso for the canvas instead of the finished painting:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Themes and swapping out the whole thing is an old way of thinking. Sure a theme could = painting but I&#8217;m saying why can&#8217;t we just swap out the theme.json and get the same result? Why the need for themes at all when all we need to change is theme.json.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That is a future that I would not mind striving for. It is not insurmountable, but there is an uphill climb that WordPress will undoubtedly struggle with. Without a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-case-for-a-shared-css-toolkit-in-wordpress\">standardized CSS toolkit</a> in place, switching <code>theme.json</code> files simply does not work. If WordPress tackles that problem, it takes us one step closer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <code>theme.json</code> only represents settings and styles. It says nothing about the structure of a website. Pre-configured templates are still necessary. Right now, that job sits squarely on top of the theme author&#8217;s shoulders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If and when a well-designed user experience for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/full-page-patterns-are-still-the-missing-piece-of-block-wordpress-theme-development\">full-page patterns</a> lands in WordPress (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38787\">related ticket</a>), the template argument becomes less relevant. With such a system in place and enough variety from the pattern directory, some users might not require themes to handle this.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/18055\">Starter page templates proposal.</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The only worthwhile argument I have for multiple &#8212; even 1,000s of &#8212; themes is the promise they make to the user: <em>install this thing, and you get this result</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a pizzeria owner installs WordPress on their site and begins looking for a design for their online presence. This is likely someone working all day in a hot kitchen and comes home exhausted at night. However, they hop on the computer to update tomorrow&#8217;s specials or tinker with a new homepage layout for a few minutes. Everything about that experience should be catered to their use case.  As an owner, chef, spouse, and parent, they need to quickly get things done and spend the rest of the night with their family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This and 1,000s of similar scenarios are why themes are as important today as they ever were. Not everyone has the privilege of time, the skillset, or the inclination to piece their sites together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When done well, block themes offer a controlled experience that cuts out all the cruft. They feel like they were built for <em>an audience of one</em> while being flexible enough for public release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schutzsmith <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schutzsmith/status/1502419277625888770\">later tweeted</a> in the thread that he liked <a href=\"https://elementor.com/library/\">Elementor&#8217;s Kits</a>. These are predesigned website designs that span multiple industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pattern category types, which are not currently in WordPress, could evolve into that role. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-pattern-explorer/\">Block Pattern Explorer</a> plugin enables the feature, but themes must add support for the types to appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following screenshot, I have created a &#8220;Profile Cards&#8221; type in a theme of mine, but it could be industry-specific:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block pattern category types.\n\n\n\n<p>It should be as easy as locating an industry-specific type and finding patterns for the pizzeria owner. A theme can offer that by either packaging patterns or pointing to those hosted in the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see this evolving into more of a kit-like solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I disagree with Schutzsmith&#8217;s conclusion of needing only a single theme but not the questions he is asking. Our design community cannot simply say that themes should be &#8220;this one thing&#8221; because that is what they have always been. Its members need to continually ask: <em>What is a WordPress theme?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer may be different to various groups of creators and users. If someone can get everything they need from the pattern directory without switching from Twenty Twenty-Two, maybe themes are irrelevant. If a creator simply likes building global style variations (<code>theme.json</code> files), WordPress should make it easy to use them on a wide range of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many users will still need turnkey design solutions, and themes can be the best way to facilitate that.  I do not know if that is 100, 1,000 or 5,000, but we will see how it goes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 03:57:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: Koji Launches New Block Plugin for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=131306\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/koji-launches-new-block-plugin-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4090:\"<p><a href=\"https://withkoji.com/\">Koji</a>, a popular &#8220;link in bio&#8221; platform that provides apps to the creator economy, has launched a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/koji-block-embed-block-for-koji-apps/\">WordPress plugin</a> for the block editor. The San Diego-based startup has raised <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/gometa\">$36.1M</a>, most recently securing $20M in a funding round led by Jump Capital. Koji has attracted 150,000 users since its official launch in March 2021. It offers a way for creators on TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, and other social media platforms to monetize their followings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress, along with the bloggers and creators it supports, is a cornerstone of the modern creator economy,&#8221; Koji CEO Dmitry Shapiro said. &#8220;This integration is a massive addition to the power and extensibility of WordPress, giving bloggers a frictionless and intuitive way to incorporate Koji mini apps in their content strategies.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new plugin introduces a Koji App block that gives users access to Koji&#8217;s app store and 200+ web-based mini apps. The apps offer a wide array of interactive functionality, such as e-commerce, games, video guestbook, calendar scheduling, NFT storefronts, billboards, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Koji App Store in the Block Editor</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the plugin&#8217;s description page says that it allows users to &#8220;embed any Koji app,&#8221; it&#8217;s not explicit about how that looks on the frontend. The app store launches in an overlay where you select and customize the app. In testing the plugin, I found that when when you insert the app into your WordPress site, it just shows up as a black button that says &#8220;My Koji App.&#8221; You can customize the button&#8217;s color and text, but that&#8217;s about it. The button launches the app in a lightbox-style overlay on top of the page content.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Koji App display on the frontend</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The image above is a screenshot of two buttons that Koji inserted representing a Tip Jar app and an Ask Me Anything app. There is no way to differentiate the two besides editing the text. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The screenshots on the plugin&#8217;s details page show how the app is launched over the content, but it doesn&#8217;t show what users see on the page before they click the link. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I was not particularly impressed with this first version of the plugin, as it seems to misrepresent what it actually does. The plugin places links in plain black buttons that will launch an iframe of the Koji app on the page. It doesn&#8217;t make much use of the block editor&#8217;s customization features, nor does it provide any kind of visual preview of the app on the page. Even a small thumbnail preview would be far superior to a plain black button. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin says that embedding these apps allows users to &#8220;sell downloadable files, sell custom video requests like shoutouts and birthday greetings, embed games that can be played by visitors, and more.&#8221; It does make it possible for users to do these things in the iframe popup, but the plugin doesn&#8217;t provide any kind of preview for these apps that would compel a visitor to click on them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Koji Block plugin offers a nominal integration between the Koji platform and WordPress, but misses an opportunity to display visually appealing previews within content. For an app platform with hundreds of colorful, interactive apps, the plain black button method of displaying them is uninspiring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koji collects fees on apps with e-commerce capabilities. If you are looking to collect donations or sell products on your WordPress site, there are many more homegrown (and visually appealing) ways to do so. This plugin is best-suited to creators who are already heavily using the Koji platform and want a simple way to link to an app from WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 03:02:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Post Status: Post Status Notes #489\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=94280\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-notes-489/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16778:\"<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">An App Store for WordPress.com?

This week we cover a little hidden gem within the WooCommerce plugin code: <code>wc_get_held_stock_quantity()</code>. As the name suggests, this function helps you get the amount of stock present in pending orders for a given product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your store relies on careful stock management — maybe because you handle products with a small inventory — <code>wc_get_held_stock_quantity</code> is very useful. As orders come in for a limited number of products, you can take special action. Maybe you need to cancel those orders, or maybe you want to entice the customers placing them to complete their purchases before the item goes out of stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as usual, let\'s first take a look at the function syntax and then consider a practical example of how you might use or display the returned value. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-94320\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-function-syntax\">Function syntax</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the <code>wc_get_held_stock_quantity()</code> function under <code>woocommerce\\includes\\wc-stock-functions.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * See how much stock is being held in pending orders.\n *\n * @since 3.5.0\n * @param WC_Product $product Product to check.\n * @param integer    $exclude_order_id Order ID to exclude.\n * @return int\n */\nfunction wc_get_held_stock_quantity( WC_Product $product, $exclude_order_id = 0 ) {\n	/**\n	 * Filter: woocommerce_hold_stock_for_checkout\n	 * Allows enable/disable hold stock functionality on checkout.\n	 *\n	 * @since 4.3.0\n	 * @param bool $enabled Default to true if managing stock globally.\n	 */\n	if ( ! apply_filters( \'woocommerce_hold_stock_for_checkout\', wc_string_to_bool( get_option( \'woocommerce_manage_stock\', \'yes\' ) ) ) ) {\n		return 0;\n	}\n\n	return ( new \\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Checkout\\Helpers\\ReserveStock() )-&gt;get_reserved_stock( $product, $exclude_order_id );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, there is a filter hook (<em>apply_filters</em>) at the very beginning of the function that allows you to disable the hold stock functionality. But we want this to be active to understand what the function does, so let\'s go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the <em>return</em> statement says, we need to study another function: <code>get_reserved_stock()</code>. Let\'s do a quick file search within the WooCommerce plugin files with your favorite code editor. The only search result is in <code>woocommerce\\src\\Checkout\\Helpers\\ReserveStock.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * Query for any existing holds on stock for this item.\n *\n * @param \\WC_Product $product Product to get reserved stock for.\n * @param integer     $exclude_order_id Optional order to exclude from the results.\n *\n * @return integer Amount of stock already reserved.\n */\npublic function get_reserved_stock( $product, $exclude_order_id = 0 ) {\n	global $wpdb;\n	if ( ! $this-&gt;is_enabled() ) {\n		return 0;\n	}\n	// phpcs:ignore WordPress.DB.PreparedSQL.InterpolatedNotPrepared, WordPress.DB.PreparedSQL.NotPrepared\n	return (int) $wpdb-&gt;get_var( $this-&gt;get_query_for_reserved_stock( $product-&gt;get_stock_managed_by_id(), $exclude_order_id ) );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a feeling this will take a while&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure, it seems we\'re querying the WordPress database now. But in order to find out what we\'re looking for, we\'ve got to do another file search for the <code>get_query_for_reserved_stock</code> function. Here we go; it\'s in <code>woocommerce\\src\\Checkout\\Helpers\\ReserveStock.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * Returns query statement for getting reserved stock of a product.\n *\n * @param int     $product_id Product ID.\n * @param integer $exclude_order_id Optional order to exclude from the results.\n * @return string|void Query statement.\n */\nprivate function get_query_for_reserved_stock( $product_id, $exclude_order_id = 0 ) {\n	global $wpdb;\n	$query = $wpdb-&gt;prepare(\n		\"\n		SELECT COALESCE( SUM( stock_table.`stock_quantity` ), 0 ) FROM $wpdb-&gt;wc_reserved_stock stock_table\n		LEFT JOIN $wpdb-&gt;posts posts ON stock_table.`order_id` = posts.ID\n		WHERE posts.post_status IN ( \'wc-checkout-draft\', \'wc-pending\' )\n		AND stock_table.`expires` &gt; NOW()\n		AND stock_table.`product_id` = %d\n		AND stock_table.`order_id` != %d\n		\",\n		$product_id,\n		$exclude_order_id\n	);\n\n	/**\n	 * Filter: woocommerce_query_for_reserved_stock\n	 * Allows to filter the query for getting reserved stock of a product.\n	 *\n	 * @since 4.5.0\n	 * @param string $query            The query for getting reserved stock of a product.\n	 * @param int    $product_id       Product ID.\n	 * @param int    $exclude_order_id Order to exclude from the results.\n	 */\n	return apply_filters( \'woocommerce_query_for_reserved_stock\', $query, $product_id, $exclude_order_id );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantastic! We now have our database query. Here\'s what it does:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First, the database query looks for the <code>wc_reserved_stock</code> table. I didn\'t know that myself!</li><li>Next, it sums all stock quantities for order IDs that are in pending / draft status.</li><li>Then it adds the held stock that hasn\'t expired yet.</li><li>And then it counts where the order contains a given product ID.</li><li>Finally, it counts where the order is not the excluded ID.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent stuff, another cool little function to know! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But don\'t forget!</strong> The &#8220;Hold stock&#8221; WooCommerce setting must be enabled, otherwise, there won\'t be any held stock to count up:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-752x408.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94323\" />The &#8220;Hold stock&#8221; field should not be blank so that some stock can be held and give you some results for <code>wc_get_held_stock_quantity()</code>.</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"case-study\">Case Study</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s say you have product <em>ID = 123</em> with stock <em>quantity = 10</em>, and you usually give a lot of time to your users to complete their orders. Say, &#8220;Hold stock&#8221; is, for example, 1440 [1 day in minutes]).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wouldn\'t it be cool if you could automatically trigger a reminder to customers with pending orders when their product is about to go out of stock?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve this, you can simply get the product stock and subtract the held stock from it to calculate the &#8220;actual&#8221; stock currently available for all pending orders completed within a given day. If you reach a low threshold of, for example, two items left in stock, then an email could be triggered for customers with a custom message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the email trigger, I\'ll reuse some of the code I already wrote for my &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.businessbloomer.com/woocommerce-custom-cron-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce: Send Email to Admin Every 3 Hours</a>&#8221; tutorial on Business Bloomer:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/**\n * @snippet       Send Pending Order Reminder If Actual Stock Low\n * @how-to        Get CustomizeWoo.com FREE\n * @author        Rodolfo Melogli\n * @testedwith    WooCommerce 6\n * @donate $9     https://businessbloomer.com/bloomer-armada/\n */\n\n// ---- ---- ----\n// A.

The whitepaper aggregates data from multiple sources, including the <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/\">Patchstack Vulnerability Database</a>, the Patchstack Alliance (the company&#8217;s bug bounty platform), and publicy reported CVEs from other sources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Patchstack recorded nearly 1,500 vulnerabilities, a 150% increase as compared to 2020, which recorded ~600. Patchstack found that the majority of these come from the WordPress.org directory:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The WordPress.org repository leads the way as the primary source for WordPress plugins and themes. Vulnerabilities in these components represented 91.79% of vulnerabilities added to the Patchstack database.</p><p>The remaining 8.21% of the reported vulnerabilities in 2021 were reported in premium or paid versions of the WordPress plugins or themes that are sold through other marketplaces like Envato, ThemeForest, Code Canyon, or made available for direct download only.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core shipped four security releases, and only one included a patch for a critical vulnerability. This particular vulnerability was not in WordPress itself but rather in one of its bundled open source libraries, the PHPMailer library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack estimates that 99.31% of all security bugs from 2021 were in components &#8211; WordPress plugins and themes. Themes had the most critical vulnerabilities, logging 55 this year. Patchstack found that 12.4% of vulnerabilities reported in themes had a critical CVSS score of 9.0-10.0. Arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities were the most common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins had a total of 35 critical security issues. This is fewer vulnerabilities compared to themes, but 29% of these received no public patch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The most surprising finding was really also the most unfortunate truth,&#8221; Patchstack Security Advocate Robert Rowley said. &#8220;I was not expecting to see so many plugins with critical vulnerabilities in them not receive patches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some of those vulnerabilities required no authentication to perform, and  have publicly available proof of concepts (exploit code) made widely available online. It is probably already too late for the site owners who did not get a notice that their websites were vulnerable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /><a href=\"https://patchstack.com/whitepaper/the-state-of-wordpress-security-in-2021/\">Patchstack: State of WordPress Security in 2021</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack surveyed 109 WordPress site owners and found that 28% of respondents had zero budget for security, 27% budgeted $1-3/month, and just 7% budget ~$50/month. Agencies were more likely to allocate monthly costs to security than individual site owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, results from these same respondents showed$613 as the average cost of malware removal. Post-compromise cleanup prices reported ranged from $50 &#8211; $4,800.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rowley sees the significant increase in security vulnerabilities found in 2021 as evidence of more engaged security professionals, not a sign of the WordPress ecosystem becoming less secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most likely this is due to more security bugs being reported (more vulnerable code being found, because more people are looking),&#8221; Rowley said. &#8220;Patchstack runs a bug bounty program which pays security researchers for the bugs they report in the WordPress ecosystem, which incentives security researchers (and even developers familiar with WordPress) to look for more security bugs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Patchstack&#8217;s findings this year show that WordPress core is very secure and the vast majority of vulnerabilities are found in themes and plugins. Users should monitor their extensions and periodically check to see if they have been abandoned, as not all vulnerable software is guaranteed to get patched.

The 6.0 Beta 1 is on April 12. Even with a slightly extended cycle, major updates come fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39293\">opened a discussion</a> in the Gutenberg repository on Tuesday. She posted:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Across the community, I&#8217;m getting questions around when the beta label for the site editor will be removed. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/26/preliminary-roadmap-for-6-0/\">While not explicitly stated in the 6.0 post</a>, I know it&#8217;s been discussed around having it removed for 6.0 as this was meant to be a temporary label to communicate that the site editor is still in early stages.</p><p>In order to track this concern and have a place to point people, I&#8217;m opening this issue so, when the time comes, a decision can be made and folks can be notified.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39293#issuecomment-1062196015\">In response</a>, Courtney Robertson said she would like to see a unified effort on creating support material across LearnWP, HelpHub, and DevHub. &#8220;What would the community&#8217;s expectation be for supporting resources related to beta, and what capacity do teams have to reach that goal?&#8221; she asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39293#issuecomment-1064194620\">In a separate reply</a>, she posed additional questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What does the 3rd party ecosystem struggle with today for adopting FSE?</li><li>What impact with this have for end site builders using products (plugins) that want to but can&#8217;t yet work with Site Editor because features are missing (custom post types, templates, shortcodes) and the following impact to their clients?</li><li>What areas feel incomplete yet in Site Editor?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Before removing the label, we need feedback about the expectations when there is no beta label,&#8221; she wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Stine <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39293#issuecomment-1064468572\">noted accessibility issues</a> as a blocker for removing the beta label. Dave Ryan <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39293#issuecomment-1064381967\">added items</a> that theme authors were still hard-coding because they are unsupported in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding the WordPress 5.0 Gutenberg debacle should be a priority. The block editor was arguably the worst feature rollout in the platform&#8217;s history, one that has left a fractured community that is, over three years later, still picking up some of the pieces of itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem was more about communication than anything. It was not that the block editor was in and of itself a poor product. It just felt very much like beta software that was switched on overnight &#8212; the platform&#8217;s users its guinea pigs. Plus, the lack of a built-in method of staying on the classic editor without installing a plugin made for a rough transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39293#issuecomment-1064275953\">noted a similar risk</a> with removing the beta label early:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy] talked about <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/02/11/a-theory-of-technology-adoption-in-the-wordpress-project/\">the impact and experience of social proof not being on Gutenberg&#8217;s side early on in the project</a>. I think a lot of that had to do with how things were presented and a bunch of PR issues. Removing the beta label from the Site Editor could be just as problematic.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some FSE features like block-based widgets and nav menus have also had problematic rollouts. Developers and end-users have often needed to scramble for solutions without an appropriate transition period before switching the features on when ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the site editor and global styles have been entirely opt-in FSE features thus far. That is not changing anytime soon. Users must explicitly activate a block theme to access them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has made for a far gentler transition, allowing early adopters to test the waters before the rest of the world. And, make no mistake, the site editor and block-based themes fundamentally change how WordPress&#8217;s theme and customization system has worked for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will be lucky if even 100 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">block themes</a> are in the official directory when WordPress 6.0 launches. Today, there are 53, a fraction of the 1,000s of themes in total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is little harm that could be done by keeping the site editor in beta for a while longer. When something breaks, it feels better knowing it is an experimental feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it must come to an end one day as we peel back the label and let the site editor shine in its own light. It cannot stay in beta endlessly, and &#8220;6.0&#8221; is a nice, round, feel-good number. Despite WordPress marching to the beat of its own versioning drum, it does not erase how much those &#8220;x.0&#8221; releases feel like they should be revolutionary in some way.

Classic design submissions still outpace them by margins that make it look like blocks are not even in the race yet. However, some designers seek to pioneer this still-foreign space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Gardner is not new to this. His latest theme, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/avant-garde/\">Avant-Garde</a>, plays on the block system&#8217;s strengths without forcing it into something it is not capable of yet. It also does not hurt that Gardner leans into minimalism with his designs. The simplicity of the block system plays back into his strengths, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Reading through the code and browsing Avant-Garde&#8217;s design elements almost feels like taking a master-class in block theme development. Other than a typo where &#8220;Primary&#8221; is misspelled in the color palette (fixed in version 1.0.2), it seems to be doing everything right. It is vying for my coveted favorite theme of 2022 award, but we still have nearly a full 10 months left before the year is out. A lot can happen in that time. However, Avant-Garde raises the bar for those that follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one thing I am not fond of, so let us get this out of the way. The content area of single posts and pages is split into two columns. The title and meta are aligned left with the content to the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Single post view.\n\n\n\n<p>I like the willingness to break from the mold &#8212; it is titled <em>Avant-Garde</em>, after all. However, I never felt comfortable with the right-aligned content, even after tinkering with the theme for a week. Center or left-aligned is more natural.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I will sound like a broken record, but this is why I enjoy using the site editor. If I find a theme that covers 80% of what I want, I can customize it. Even as a designer and developer, this was often more trouble than it was worth with classic themes. Every theme developer had their in-house design system to figure out. Blocks always follow the same standard. Moving a column here or putting the post title over there simply induces fewer headaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I made a couple of minor changes to single posts. <em>No big deal.</em> I erased my single dislike about the theme in mere moments via the site editor, and all was right with the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing the layout of the single post template.\n\n\n\n<p>Where Avant-Garde gets things right is its patterns. It bundles 14 in total, and one is of the <a href=\"https://bg.design/avant-garde/\">homepage design from the demo</a>. Users do not have to piece it together; just insert and customize. This is the primary reason I have called for a separate <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/full-page-patterns-are-still-the-missing-piece-of-block-wordpress-theme-development\">full-page pattern feature</a> in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite block pattern in the theme is for creating a portfolio:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Portfolio pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>It is merely a Heading, Paragraph, and a three-by-three grid of Image blocks. It feels like something anyone should be capable of building, but the simple elegance combined with on-point spacing is sometimes more complex than it looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also warming up to the list-style Query pattern as someone who enjoys writing from time to time and does not want to worry about finding the perfect featured image:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />List-style Query pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Avant-Garde includes a couple of alternative Query patterns for a grid and a one-column post list for those who prefer something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rarely get to point to footer design as a positive attribute of themes. Far too often, this section is tacked on as if it had no right being there in the first place.  However, Avant-Garde has not one but two footers that say, &#8220;Hey, do I have your attention?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is the default, which includes the text &#8220;Design with courage.&#8221; in large lettering:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Default footer design.\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative is a business-friendly, full-width lead-in for visitors to contact the site owner:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Contact-style footer.\n\n\n\n<p>Avant-Garde has a short pattern for displaying copyright text and links for those who prefer a footer that seeks less attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme does not include many custom block styles. A few fill-type and outline Button options can be replaced when core supports borders on the block. A &#8220;no margin&#8221; style for Paragraphs handles a missing WordPress feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its more unique options include shadow and full-height styles for the Group block. It also offers framed images, which are showcased in the portfolio pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I want to see more themes like Avant-Garde land in the directory. The design does not push against every boundary &#8212; though it does experiment plenty. What makes it a solid choice is the attention to detail. The little things matter, such as selecting the right photos for the demo and not leaving the footer design as an afterthought.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 04:11:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Post Status: Addressing Burnout with Sherry Walling\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=94258\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://poststatus.com/addressing-burnout-with-sherry-walling/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4639:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Burnout is a real disorder you can think of as a repetitive strain injury of the mind, says Sherry Walling, a clinical psychologist and entrepreneur adept at “helping smart people do hard things.” Dr. Walling was gracious with her time in this episode of <strong>Post Status Live</strong>, where she explains what occupational burnout is, what the symptoms are, and how to address it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-topics-discussed\"><strong>Topics Discussed </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Maslach\">Christina Maslach</a> (UC-Berkeley) </li><li>Maslick\'s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslach_Burnout_Inventory\">theory of occupational burnout</a></li><li>Compassion fatigue</li><li>Causes and symptoms of burnout</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Burnout &#8230;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8230;is a real disorder, not a made up term in pop psychology.</li><li>&#8230;leads to physical and emotional exhaution, cynicism and withdrawal, and a diminished sense of personal efficacy — &#8220;I suck!&#8221;</li><li>&#8230;is caused (and predicted) by lack of meaning in your work effort and lack of social supports.</li><li>&#8230;is like a repetitive strain injury.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-about-sherry-walling\">About Sherry Walling</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><img width=\"298\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2022-03-08-at-10.32.25-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94261\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Sherry Walling is a clinical psychologist, speaker, podcaster, best-selling author, yoga teacher, and mental health advocate.

Password Protected was by far his most popular one with more than 300,000 active installs. The acquisition is hot on the heels of the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpexperts-acquires-post-smtp-plugin\">purchase of the Post SMTP plugin</a> two weeks ago, another product with more than 300k active installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password Protected gained a large user base by providing a simple plugin that doesn&#8217;t try to do everything. It allows an administrator to set a password to protect their WordPress site. It includes just a handful of options, such as toggling access to feeds, allowing REST API access, and disabling password requirement for administrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s users often request the ability to add a login logo, and the plugin keeps it simple by recommending compatible plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-logo/\">Login Logo</a> or the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/uber-login-logo/\">Uber Login Logo</a> plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not had much time to dedicate to the Password Protected plugin over the last couple of years,&#8221; Huson said regarding the sale. &#8220;I do use it myself and check for compatibility issues, but have not necessarily been pro-active in updating its compatibility flag in the WP repository.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huson said he has always tried to keep the plugin simple but with lots of hooks so that it would be extensible and ready for paid add-ons or a pro version in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I regularly got emails from people interested in acquiring the plugin as it has a good user base on the WP repository,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One of my main concerns in the past was that I wanted to have confidence in whoever takes it on.&#8221; Huson checked out WPExperts portfolio and said he had no worries the team would be able to take the plugin forward and develop it further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the success of Password Protected&#8217;s tightly controlled feature set, WPExperts founder Saad Iqbal said he plans to introduce some updates with an aim to produce a commercial version in a few months. He shared a few of the features they have in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Make this plugin more developer-friendly by adding more actions and filter hooks so the dev community can easily play around. </li><li>Display option to redirect to the login window. If someone with an admin role visits the protected page, we can display something like: If you are an admin of this site, please click here to login, or if you are an existing user, click here to login. </li><li>We can add support for more user roles apart from the Administrator, as it is currently, to make it more flexible. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite gaining a much larger team to support the plugin, users are not always happy when a tool they have embraced changes hands. A plugin that was once the pet project of one developer, has now joined a larger agency that will soon be looking to monetize the software. After WPExperts&#8217; last acquisition, one reader <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpexperts-acquires-post-smtp-plugin#comment-417445\">commented</a> that &#8220;takeover by an agency is usually the death knell for plugins,&#8221; as the new owners seek to add &#8220;unnecessary features&#8221; to a plugin that was previously focused in terms of development. Users do not relish the prospect of getting new banners and calls in the dashboard to pay for a Pro version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to these concerns, Iqbal said WPExperts maintains a system for ensuring each plugin has adequate coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have developed small team clusters for managing this kind of traffic,&#8221; Iqbal said. &#8220;So each team manages a couple of plugins, backed by strong support and business analyst teams, which keep track of all the issues and feature requests to be addressed. This makes sure nothing gets overlooked.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 20:16:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"Post Status: The Things That Unite Us\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=93166\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://poststatus.com/the-things-that-unite-us/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17392:\"<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The things that unite us aren\'t always what we expect. And sometimes they\'re the same things that divide us — or at least a fraction of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Early this year we saw the rise of a simple daily word puzzle: Wordle. Suddenly, overnight, everyone (and I mean <em>almost</em> <em>everyone</em>) was posting their Wordle daily scores on Twitter and in our most active Post Status Slack channel. It was so prevalent that we created a new channel called #Diversions, for folks to post Wordle scores and other pastimes — and to keep the #Club channel about the things it\'s always been about — namely, <em>not</em> Wordle scores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, not <em>everyone</em> was excited about Wordle. Some people spent more time lamenting other people\'s scores filling their Twitter feed than it would take to just scroll past them. But that was part of the fun of it too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The culture — and counterculture — that Wordle inspired was <em>fun</em>. Organizations from NFL teams to restaurants to Post Status posted their normal stuff in light of it being simply &#8220;Not Wordle.&#8221; (Yes, we had to get in on the fun, too!)</p>\n\n\n\n<div

href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status/status/1486847007021010944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Diversions can unite us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-community-is-built-on-unity\">Community Is Built on Unity </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Unity&#8221; is the latter part of the word &#8220;community.&#8221; So it stands to reason that communities like Post Status, and the greater WordPress community have things in common — the things that unite us. Of course, at the center of it is WordPress. The Open Source Project is central to our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we are people. People with different politics, different viewpoints, different hobbies, beliefs, religions&#8230;well you see what I mean. We each arrive in a community around a central <em>thing</em>, but we bring our own experiences with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past week we\'ve seen a lot of community rally around our friends and colleagues in Ukraine. Watching a war break out in that part of the world is heartbreaking. Many of us have offered support in different ways — from monetary donations to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DriveForUkraine&src=hashtag_click\">caravaning to Poland to bring physical supplies</a> to sharing information and holding space for friends (and their families) in affected areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some choose to use their skills to create solidarity and share it through open source so that others can display their solidarity also. And we have no way of knowing the countless others who, in their own less-public way, provide the support they choose and are able to give.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I made a thing. <br />Install on your WordPress site to show your support, while at the same time sharing the relevant donation URL with the world <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine%EF%B8%8F?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StandWithUkraine</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ETCW7rfylx\">https://t.co/ETCW7rfylx</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AlJqMYwuJ1\">pic.twitter.com/AlJqMYwuJ1</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Bossenger (@jon_bossenger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_bossenger/status/1500167746868416522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>War can unite us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-pandemic-has-changed-us\">The Pandemic Has Changed Us</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There have always been things that unite us. Remember the Ice Bucket Challenge? Or how TikTok has crept into every age group and demographic? And in every time zone on December 31 the stroke of midnight brings people together with the hope of a better next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The global pandemic has changed how we view the things that unite us. In spite of <em>not</em> being able to get together physically, separation somehow made the world a smaller place. Zoom and other videoconferencing tools are used for purposes beyond education and business. Grandparents met their new grandchildren through their screens. Birthdays were celebrated by people many miles apart. Weddings were broadcast to family and friends. WordCamps and Big Orange Heart\'s WordFests were delivered virtually. And meetups have been online — allowing people from around the world to learn from and interact with others they never could have met when things only took place in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pandemics unite us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"there-is-no-panacea\">There is No Panacea</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there is no one thing that will unite every person on one topic, one thought, or one idea. There will always be differences of opinion, dissent, and drama. (Remember how I said we\'re people?) But differences, dissent, and, yes, even drama, are what make us a rich community. (Remember Gutenberg in 2018?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The things that unite us — both positive and negative — have the power to move us closer to one another, inspire greater support of each other, and make the world — or at least our community in it — a smaller (and better) place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile has-background\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vertical-post-status-logo-250.png\" alt=\"Post Status\" class=\"wp-image-85823 size-full\" /></a><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size\" id=\"h-get-ready-for-remote-work\">You — and <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/business-membership/\">your whole team</a> can <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-membership-club/\">Join Post Status</a> too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\"><strong>Build your network.

And so without further delay, I bring you Destiny Kanno and Joe Simpson. I am joined on the podcast by two people Destiny Kanno, and Joe Simpson. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:00] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Hey Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:01] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Hey there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I take it one at a time, if that&#8217;s all right, I&#8217;ll start with you. Destiny. We&#8217;re going to have a conversation today about a subject, which is probably, let&#8217;s say it will be broad and deep and probably some different opinions will arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, first of all, I think it might be nice to have a little bit of a background story of both of you. Briefly or in long form, whichever you prefer. Destiny, could you give us a little bit of background? How come you&#8217;re on a WordPress podcast? What&#8217;s your relationship to the WordPress community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:31] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yes. Thank you for the intro, Nathan. So I started my journey with WordPress in 2017. I was working at a small Japanese digital agency, and at the time we were working on a few WordPress sites, but, to be fully honest, I didn&#8217;t really get that involved with them until I switched over to Automattic as a dot com happiness engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where my real push to learn WordPress better started off. And I did that for about two years, moved over to the WordPress VIP sector, working with large enterprise clients using WordPress at scale. And now I currently sit in our dot org division with a lovely community member people, who are working in that area, as a developer relations as advocate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. Indeed. Could I ask the same question of you, Joe? Briefly what&#8217;s your relationship with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:25] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Oh sure. Nathan, my journey is two-pronged, it&#8217;s a before and an after. Way back around 2011, I worked for a public transit agency here in Los Angeles, and our CSS goddess and lead developer both left our company within a month of each other. And I inherited a WordPress site. I was a graphic designer turned HTML novice, and I had to quickly learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was my first experience with the WordPress community. We were able to move our site over to WordPress VIP. And from that point I learned about WordPress in a disciplined way. How to commit code properly and things like that. So speed ahead to 2017, I had a heart event. 200% blocked artery, and I had to take a leave of absence from work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that 90 day period, I decided to do the things that I really loved. And one of the things that had such a positive impact on me was WordPress. And I attended my first meetup. I decided later instead of driving into Los Angeles, and getting home at 11 o&#8217;clock at night after work, I wanted to start a community locally here in Santa Clarita, where there wasn&#8217;t one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also that became a WordCamp. And we hosted three WordCamps here in Santa Clarita. So I&#8217;ve been in the community as a builder, as a community rep, and now I&#8217;m on the team. I&#8217;m a team rep for the WordPress, make WordPress accessibility team. And now that leads me to this initiative as well. I&#8217;m trying to give back in different ways and in effect, WordPress from a different angle now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, I&#8217;m going to be referring during the course of this, to an article which was written by Justin Tadlock over on WP Tavern. It was called BlackPress meetup to host meet and greet mixer on the 27th of January. That has now been and gone. This episode will probably be going out in March 2022. And so I want to know from both of you and it doesn&#8217;t matter who begins first or whether you cross talk, that&#8217;s absolutely fine, we can work that out later. I want to know what this event was all about. Why did you two decide to create the BlackPress meet up, and also slack channel? What was the primary thinking? What were you trying to accomplish?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question, Nathan. So from my side of things, at Automattic, I co-founded our black employee resource group which we call Cocomatic, in April, 2020. And so for me, working with that group, we wanted to figure out a way to also bring this community to folks of black African descent, into the WordPress community space as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I worked alongside another colleague of mine, Neisha Sweet, to come together, the community side and work on what we now call BlackPress, and bring that to life. In our initial initiatives or ideas that we had in our first talks were about students really, you know, bringing more students of color, specifically black students across the globe. So that&#8217;s why we say black African descent, into WordPress and giving them that kind of mentorship, sponsorship, earlier in the process so that they can really get involved, whether it&#8217;s in high school or ideally in college. And we also had talks about targeting HBCU, historically black universities and colleges as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that really was in my mind, and Joe, please add on, you know, like the birth of why we wanted to have this initiative at the beginning,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:48] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> And I&#8217;m on the other side of the fence where I&#8217;m fully in the community and I&#8217;m an open source advocate, and I use it as part of my day to day. And my community activities brought me to this initiative as well. Someone on the foundation side, reached out to me and mentioned that there were some folks interested in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for me, the reason that I got involved with WordPress and I decided to take the stage as a speaker, was that I didn&#8217;t see anybody that looked like me on stage and I decided to propose a speech and then it went from there. So, this was a natural fit for me because I have a nephew that attended an HBCU and just the initiative of reaching a larger global audience and getting more people involved in how we can impact WordPress and its direction was very exciting for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just ask you to tell me what an HBCU is? Because that acronym is not one that&#8217;s in my vocabulary?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:43] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah. So that&#8217;s a historically black university and college. It&#8217;s mainly a, I believe, an American thing, stemming off of, segregation in our past here. We have a few members of BlackPress that went to those schools, and so that was a target area for us of bringing more folks into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, thank you. That just cleared that up for me, that&#8217;s great. So you had your first event back in January. I&#8217;d just like to figure out what your thoughts were on how that went. So if we could just open up your little history book, how did the meeting go? Was It well attended? Did you manage to make some decisions about what it is that you&#8217;re going to be doing in the future? You can take this in whichever direction you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:23] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> It had a great meetup attendee, yes. We had about 24 folks say, yes, we want to do this. But I think with all community events, about half is going to come if you&#8217;re lucky more than that. And so we were just grateful when the day came, when we had about nine folks, including Joe and myself attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the discussions we had were definitely about, where we&#8217;re coming from in terms of our WordPress journey. Where we&#8217;d like to improve ourselves. And also what we&#8217;d like to get out of the BlackPress group. And that included, you know, how to make your site better, to how to be a better developer. Talking about design. There&#8217;s a lot of things that folks want to share and learn about together within this group is what we discovered during the mixer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Yeah, what was really awesome too, is that not just in the meetup space did people express an interest in BlackPress? There was Slack channel that was set up. That channel has grown incredibly fast, as the word is getting out, and as meetups are basically word of mouth, then you have to get the word out and then eventually more people would join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had an online Slack discussion that was well attended as well. So it&#8217;s really exciting that people are coming to our space to talk and discuss these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have a fixed agenda about what it is that you would like to achieve? Or are you still very much in the stages of trying to work out with those people who show up what it is that you want the project to become, who it is that you want to take the responsibility for certain things? Do you have any things solidified yet, or is it still very much figuring it all out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:56] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> We are still very much hoping to get to this large HBCU college style, WordCamp style event. And so we&#8217;re looking for folks to step up to organize, but we also understand that that takes a bit of onboarding, and resource sharing in order to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:15] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> And to add onto that, I know in general, as a meetup organizer myself, these things take time. But it&#8217;s always based on the energy, enthusiasm of people that come to the project. So, as we get more and more people on board, and, for example, the Slack channel is a great place where everyday someone&#8217;s sharing information, starting the discussion, so those type of people hopefully will take a larger role in the group and the group will just grow organically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Could you drop the URL? I will put it in the show notes, but perhaps one of you could say it out loud so that anybody listening, perhaps sitting in a cafe or something could put their phone down and go and actually visit that site. What&#8217;s the URL for the Slack channel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:59] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Oh the Slack channel. It&#8217;s a super long gobbledygook URL. We could probably create a short link for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, I&#8217;ll add it into the show notes. So I would add that anybody listening to this, just head over to the show notes on WP Tavern, and look for the podcast section there, and from there you can find those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was interested to hear you Joe say, we&#8217;re going to be straying into an area which maybe is uncomfortable. I don&#8217;t know. See how we go. You said that you were concerned in the past that you&#8217;d attended events and there was nobody that looked like you. Two things that I want to ask from that. First thing, what does that feel like? That&#8217;s my first question. And secondly, has any of that changed in the recent past?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:43] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> I would say to clarify the statement, it was that I didn&#8217;t see people that look like me on stage. Now in the WordPress community, there were people that look like me in the audience, at all the WordCamps that I had attended, but again, seeing someone on stage and talking about WordPress, I hadn&#8217;t seen that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And ironically, the first event that I was accepted to, directly before me, Joe Howard presented. So that very day was the first day I saw someone. So from that point forward, it&#8217;s become more and more diverse in the WordPress space, diversity has been a big point of emphasis over the past three or four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would say it&#8217;s changed dramatically. And I know for me, in the communities that I&#8217;m involved with, that&#8217;s always an emphasis on what we do. The WordCamps that we&#8217;ve started, our organizing team has been incredibly diverse. Our WordCamps have all been at least 50 50 or a larger percentage in the other direction in terms of being a well-represented and diverse in terms of gender, as well as race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s just something that happens naturally in the spaces that I try to associate with, or that I flow within. So it&#8217;s just natural. And to me, I think you mentioned that some uncomfortability or things of that nature. For me, my experiences in the WordPress space haven&#8217;t been that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to make sure that whenever someone&#8217;s involved with initiatives I&#8217;m involved in, it should always be open to anyone and everyone, and make sure that you feel that you can express yourself and get your ideas across.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Destiny. Could I ask you the same question? Now, obviously it doesn&#8217;t reflect back on something that you said earlier, but I&#8217;m guessing that there are moments in the past where you&#8217;ve looked around you at events and just pondered those questions. What is the mix of people in this arena? And am I going to feel comfortable? Should I be one of the speakers? Do I feel comfortable here? Are people represented equally?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:31] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah. So I have to out myself. I have not been to a WordCamp yet, say that with a single tear in my eye. I&#8217;ll be there at WordCamp EU. So in terms of like a WordCamp style event I don&#8217;t have any experience that I can speak to, but in terms of other events, and just growing into myself as well. Definitely, it&#8217;s true what Joe is saying. Just seeing someone that looks like you in speaker or organizing position, is a bit of a position of power, right? In those positions where you&#8217;re showing leadership or you&#8217;re showing what you could become. A person in this space that&#8217;s respected and well listened to is important to folks of all kinds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I&#8217;m going to events, I&#8217;m looking for that, but I&#8217;m also in the community space, seeing how people treat me. Am I able to speak my mind respectfully, of course, in a way that&#8217;s true to myself? Am I able to come in and be vulnerable too and not be laughed at because my experience in the space, or perhaps the fact that I am the only black woman in the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So not just being on stage, but also just how we can navigate the spaces are two things that I look for in an inclusive kind of event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;d really like for this podcast to possibly make people think about something that they haven&#8217;t really been confronted with before, and so I&#8217;m going to return to the question if it&#8217;s okay with you the actuality. Now, in Destiny&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s not going to be a WordPress event, and Joe, you may like to cast your mind to a WordPress event, or it may be something completely different because I just want to put myself in your shoes for a moment where you attend an event and you look around the room and it&#8217;s pretty clear that the representation is not what it could be. Make of that what you will. I want to know what that actually feels like. I apologize if that&#8217;s a question, which is something that you don&#8217;t wish to answer, but I&#8217;m going to ask it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:27] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Joe, do you want to go first on that one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:29] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Oh, sure. For me, and I shared this story over time. When I first got into the community. That enthusiasm or that level of excitement that you often feel when you&#8217;re around someone that&#8217;s new to WordPress or open source or something that they&#8217;re really interested in. I needed to harness it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And initially, my local WordCamp here, I want it to be involved and I had all these ideas and I was sketching out things. And if you know me, I go overboard. And I&#8217;d proposed all these ideas and how I wanted to get involved, and unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t in that events clique, so to speak, and no fault of theirs, every event is based on relationships between the organizers and the volunteers and things of that nature. I was just some new guy. What that rejection or what that inability to have my ideas heard, what that spawned was, what I&#8217;ve done here locally in Santa Clarita or what I&#8217;ve tried to do in everything that I&#8217;ve been involved in is just to bring my voice and have my voice heard and be in the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s motivation for me. I think anytime we get a rejection or a no, for me, it just drives me to get involved and become part of that discussion. That&#8217;s just me personally, and I can&#8217;t speak for others. But I feel like in terms of being a diverse person in a non-diverse environment and having people consider other ideas. I&#8217;ll give you a different example. In WordCamps, for example, sometimes they ask for very specific things in terms of the speakers that they&#8217;re looking for. For example, there was an event in Canada and they only wanted, I think Gutenberg topics. And so that limits the type of presentations they&#8217;ll get. It may be exciting in terms of pushing something that&#8217;s hot in the WordPress community through, but just naturally it excludes people that don&#8217;t have expertise in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just having people consider all different options or all different voices is something that isn&#8217;t done. And I think these type of initiatives bring that to light and that can only help in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. Destiny, same question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:33] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah, so I&#8217;ll draw on a bit of life experience for this one. So I lived in Japan for about five years and that is a country where, you really need to speak Japanese to get around for the most part. So, this is a feeling I think anyone can have, right. This feeling of either alienation because you haven&#8217;t been able to learn the language and bond with the people in a way that is respectful to their culture, but also you understand their culture. And so you can either, blend in, walk the walk and talk the talk, or you can feel alienation. And that&#8217;s one like from the ex-pat kind of spectrum. I think there&#8217;s a more simpler example that I can give, like taking us all, that we&#8217;ve all been. I shouldn&#8217;t say all, a lot of people have been schoolchildren, and I think most of us know what it&#8217;s like to be maybe the new kid at school or start your first day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to think that most kids, they don&#8217;t come in thinking about white supremacist culture and all of these things. We&#8217;re just going to school, we, we&#8217;re listening to our emo music or whatever that is. You know, othering people based on appearances, and in that scenario, I think is, an indoctrination process, based on systemic societal issues, because as a child, you&#8217;re just thinking, oh my gosh anyone like me, I might like some grunge music that no one&#8217;s ever heard of. And in that case you&#8217;re trying to fit in any way you can. And maybe you&#8217;ll find the people that accept you no matter what, or maybe you won&#8217;t. But in that scenario, I personally think a lot of the time, it&#8217;s not about, skin tone, it&#8217;s about, cliques and whether or not you&#8217;re going to be accepted. So, definitely not WordPress examples, but I feel like these are two things that I think anyone can wrap their mind around, this feeling of being othered in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We talk often in the WordPress space that it&#8217;s basically open to anybody. The idea being that it&#8217;s open source software. If you have a desire to be part of the community, you can because everybody is available. Maybe there&#8217;s some discussion to be had here because I have a feeling having spoken to a variety of people over the last few years about this, that may not be entirely true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, being able to show up and contribute, may be contingent upon a whole bunch of other factors. So for example, your ability to have the time available, your ability to have your employer second you into work. Your ability to be in a situation where you are, I don&#8217;t know, stable enough and have enough support to allow you to have the free time and so on and so forth. I wonder if there&#8217;s anything to say about that, about the wider goals of open source software in this case, WordPress, and whether or not you feel that WordPress as a whole needs to think more about this notion of well, anybody can contribute because it&#8217;s totally open to everybody. Is that true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:25] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> I think it&#8217;s true in that anyone can contribute, like full-stop right. Anyone with a computer and internet access. So those are two requirements actually, can contribute. Other than that, there&#8217;s other factors like how well will you be recognized for your contributions. Who is getting recognized?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So contribution only goes so far, but participation, sponsorship, being seen in leadership roles, there&#8217;s a whole other area where, maybe some folks cannot break through as easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Joe, any thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Well, I mean, I do think it&#8217;s possible and I think it happens everyday. It&#8217;s just a matter of making those opportunities available, to as wide an audience as possible. I know I participated in some diverse speaking workshops, and I know in terms of the events that I&#8217;ve done, we&#8217;ve made a conscious effort to include new speakers, to include people who haven&#8217;t presented before, and we offer them training, or give them a stage. They can come and speak at our meetup to practice and to get that sense of ownership or that sense of buy-in. And I think that&#8217;s for me, finding out where those avenues for inclusion are and making sure that they&#8217;re available and known to people that are coming into the community. Those voices that are diverse, making sure that they know that there are opportunities to do that. And the example that I gave earlier in terms of that frustration that I had when I first wanted to get involved with a WorkCamp event, I didn&#8217;t know that there was a call for speakers or call for organizing. I mean, I didn&#8217;t know of any of the paths or processes that were already in place because I was new and sometimes things in the open source community, you have to figure out on your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me, with an initiative like this, what I&#8217;m hoping is that this collaboration with the folks on the Automattic side and our community, is this new collaboration can open up so many more doors for people to get involved in making sure that if you want to speak, hey, you should do this. Hey, this event&#8217;s coming up. They need organizers. This is how you help organize. And being that conduit will only make things more diverse and more inclusive. I think a lot of times those avenues are, they expect that you know those, but most people don&#8217;t. So what I always try to do in our community events and hopefully as we move forward with this one is to make sure that people know the path or the opportunities that are there and how they can take full advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s do a little bit of blue sky thinking. Let&#8217;s imagine that the BlackPress project is a runaway success. And a couple of years from now, you know, there&#8217;s a real up swelling of support and the community has grown really strongly, and all of the issues that you&#8217;ve dealt with today have been looked at and addressed, and you&#8217;ve come up with some novel solutions for different problems. Do you just want to give us some ideas about the kind of things that you would, Joe, you just touched on a few of them, but the concrete things that you want to have happen. In other words, how many people would you like to be a part of that community? What kind of job titles, for want of a better word, would you like to have? What kind of documents would you like to have produced or videos or whatever it may be? What concrete things would you wish could happen, let&#8217;s say two years from now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> I would say in an ideal world two years from now, we would have folks from every region of the world, involved in the project, maybe even some, EU, EMEA APAC channels as well. Just connecting us all, in WordPress, in the BlackPress community. That would be an amazing goal. All of that network essentially, folks that anywhere in the world you go, there&#8217;s going to be a WordPresser that you can connect with or see at a WordCamp and enjoy time with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s definitely in my mind, a amazing goal for us to have. BlackPress Isn&#8217;t trying to replace the larger WordPress community, it&#8217;s not trying to become like a make Slack in that way, and at least in my mind, Joe definitely correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:19] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> I totally agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:20] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah, like we, but we still want to have a space where, as you got to Nathan, you know, we can help better circulate opportunities amongst each other. We can help better sponsor, mentor, prepare each other for organizer roles, for speaking engagements. So that is definitely a goal that we have, and are iterating on, even right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:40] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Destiny summed it up pretty well. I mean, just having that place where we can help the next generation of contributors and creators in the WordPress space would be awesome. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if BlackPress had panel at WordCamp US or WordCamp Europe? Or if we do an HBCU, a WordCamp style event. What if we did a world event? In the past three years? What I&#8217;ve really been excited about is, the pandemic has forced us all inward, unfortunately, but the offshoot of that is that all of our meetups are now global. We have people that come in from Europe that come in from Africa that come in from Australia, growing it into Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those kinds of things are really exciting because, not all of us can travel to a WordCamp event, even when everything was in person. I may not be able to fly to WordCamp US in Nashville, for example, because of work commitments or personal commitment, the virtual spaces allowed us to grow in a different direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m excited that once things go back to a more in-person or even a hybrid situation, those people that we&#8217;ve reached out to all over the world will really have an impact on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much, indeed. So that was our blue sky thinking moment. We were casting the net two years into the future and imagining what great things are possible. Let&#8217;s go back to today, rein it in a little bit. You&#8217;ve obviously beginning something. The enthusiasm is often great at the beginning and then reality of what needs to be done sets in and you realize that, okay, this is where we&#8217;re at we haven&#8217;t reached these grand goals. Right now. If I could wave a magic wand and give you the things that you need to happen in the next couple of months, what would those look like? Are you looking for new membership? Is it all about the people? Is it trying to find people from different locales?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you really want to do in the next couple of months to kickstart this whole enterprise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:29] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Well, we had our first meetup as we noted at the beginning of this call, last month. So to keep momentum we&#8217;re continuing with our meetups. So we actually have another one tomorrow from 5:00 PM Pacific time. And that is with Allie Nimmons from Underrepresented in Tech, discussing that. Next month we have one coming up to discuss 5.9 and full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is keeping up with our meetups is one way that we&#8217;re hoping to definitely increase membership and grow our community. I don&#8217;t think I said before, but when we started in January this year kicking off these events in our Slack, we only had about 17 ish people. Now we&#8217;re at 50 in our BlackPress meetup as well. We are hitting 50 plus as well. We are seeing people being excited about this initiative and we&#8217;re growing and that&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s going to help us toward our goals of creating these events as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so more boots on the ground, more people, fresh ideas. And I guess that&#8217;s the nice thing about growing a community at the beginning is that you have a vague idea of where the direction of travel would like to go, but then the people arrive and maybe hijack the enterprise and say, actually, what about this idea? Oh, that&#8217;s curious, I didn&#8217;t think about trying that out. Let&#8217;s give that a go. So yeah, boots on the ground would be good. Joe, anything to add to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:48] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> I was just going to say, it&#8217;s all of the things that Destiny mentioned. Just the more events you have, the more people will come. The more you get the word out, the more the group will grow. So to me, just being consistent and the events that Destiny&#8217;s mentioned will gain exposure being on podcasts, such as this one, more people will hear the message. Will hear what we&#8217;re trying to do, and hopefully it&#8217;ll come and it&#8217;ll just grow that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, one other question. It occurs to me that you obviously want the membership to grow. BlackPress we described that you&#8217;d like it to be swelling into the future. Is there any kind of walled garden around this? Is there any part of the community that you are going to welcome more? Or are you going for full inclusivity? Everybody is welcome. Please all come and give us your ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:37] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yes, this is a great question. And we get it all the time. Who is allowed, quote, unquote, allowed to join BlackPress meetup or Slack, and this meetup, and community, we treat it like any other community in WordPress. It&#8217;s welcome to all. However folks of non-black African descent, who we&#8217;re calling allies, just be aware that this is a space where, they should be uplifting black voices or looking for ways to advocate for, or sponsor or share ideas in a way that isn&#8217;t taking away from the experiences of the community here that we built. So it&#8217;s a safe space for everyone, but just keep it in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking up space as a real thing, right? And this is a space where you&#8217;re able to be, but also with an understanding that it is for folks of black African descent. We want to be able to collaborate and share ideas, but we also want to ensure that this is a safe space for the target community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really all of us that need to be doing this work to get to a better place where we don&#8217;t even, meet these kinds of offshoot communities. I think ideally everyone wants to be in that space where, everywhere in WordPress, it&#8217;s yeah, we acknowledge that you are different, and we love that you&#8217;re different. And we&#8217;re going to talk about your perspective and respect that, and we&#8217;re all going to be great, but we&#8217;re still in a space where differences are seen as something to other or not be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s, I think where this idea of that&#8217;s your space, so I don&#8217;t want to be in there bothering you, maybe comes from in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:11] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> We mentioned it at the top when we kicked off the conversation, a lot of times we&#8217;ll have people that will call out the fact that they&#8217;re not black or is it okay to ask this question a certain way? But I think that level of consciousness is what moves the discussion forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in my circles, there&#8217;s an understanding. If I generate the level respect that I should, that shouldn&#8217;t be an issue. And you&#8217;re always welcome to participate and to ask certain questions. So the story that I love to share is when I went away to college and, you know, oftentimes during spring breaks or things of that nature, you may go to your roommates, family&#8217;s home or vice versa. And I grew up in in an inner city environment. And one of my roommates, when he came with me and we were headed back to college campus, he said, wow, I didn&#8217;t know it was like that. No one really noticed I was white. And to me, that&#8217;s sort of the spirit of what I try to do in the WordPress space, it&#8217;s like, respect me, but there aren&#8217;t any walls or any barriers to what you and I, as friends or as colleagues, or as co-organizers should have. We should both be able to speak freely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And within the WordPress space where there are codes of conduct for meetups and, there&#8217;s guidelines and rules for all this stuff that is the WordPress way or the WordPress community. As long as we&#8217;re in that environment, our conversations will flow and be organic. So, it should never be an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:30] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> I was just going to add just thinking about reflecting on that question a bit more, I feel like it&#8217;s as a black person navigating the world, we have to ask that question like all the time. Can I join? Will I be accepted? Will people listen to me? So yeah, like when I think about that question now, I&#8217;m just thinking like, that&#8217;s part of, trying to become a community. I don&#8217;t know, you know, into a community. Yeah. I think it all just boils down to respect. Are you entering that space respectfully or are you trying to, make it all about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. Just before we wind it up, what would be the best place to interact with the pair of you? Maybe we&#8217;ll take it one at a time, but maybe one of you wants to deal with the usual thing, maybe there&#8217;s an email address or a Twitter handle, or let&#8217;s see if we can dig out that Slack group address or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where&#8217;s the best place to contact you about BlackPress more generally. And then if you wish to tell us specifically, where could we find you personally best online, that might be helpful too. So let&#8217;s start with Destiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:34] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah, I think the make WordPress Slack is a good space to start if you&#8217;re there. And if you&#8217;re not, you should join. And if not, you can also find me on Twitter, the destiny wp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:46] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Yeah, for the meetup group, you can find us on meetup.com slash BlackPress dash meetup. And you can find me anywhere in the WordPress space. Joe Simpson Junior on WordPress.org. Twitter, LinkedIn, it&#8217;s always Joe Simpson, Jr. So, I welcome anyone that wants to reach out and find out more about BlackPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That was really interesting. Thank you Destiny and Joe, thank you for coming onto the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:12] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Thank you, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:13] <strong>Joe Simpson:</strong> Yeah.

It can come in the form of unwanted emails, comments left by bots, and even text messages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO spam occurs when someone uses your site to try and manipulate their own search engine rankings. They can fill your website with keywords, add unwanted links, publish spammy pages, and even use your server to send emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of spam is dangerous because it can negatively affect your hard-earned search engine rankings. That’s because search engines don’t know <em>who&#8217;s </em>behind the spam — just that it’s on <em>your </em>site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years of hard work to reach the top of search results can be undone almost overnight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The various types of SEO spam attacks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how search engine spam works is the first step towards protecting yourself against it. Here are some of the black hat tactics that fall into the category of SEO spam:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Keyword injection. </strong>This is when attackers modify your content to include new keywords. Usually, those keywords will appear in high volumes, since the culprits won’t care about how that might affect your content’s readability.</li><li><strong>Link injection. </strong>Often, spammers will add new links to your website. It’s a quick way to get backlinks to their site.</li><li><strong>Spam emails. </strong>If they get access to your server, bad actors can use it to send spam emails. Depending on how aggressive they are, your own legitimate emails might start going to spam folders, even after you’ve locked out the offenders.</li><li><strong>Spam pages. </strong>Sometimes, attackers will add new pages to your website. These pages will be full of spam content, fraudulent offers, and links to sites that you don’t endorse.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Spam ads. </strong>This is when your website is used to display ads for products or services that are owned by the spammers. These ads may have little to do with your site’s content and will damage your credibility.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, SEO spam usually isn’t subtle. Instead of adding a few links or keywords, attackers will try to get the most benefit from your website before you notice what’s happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why SEO spammers target websites</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a lot of cases, attackers use bots to identify security vulnerabilities. If you have an open comments section, you’ll likely run into spam on an almost daily basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Every website is a potential target for SEO spam, but if you fail to put the proper measures in place, you run a higher risk of becoming a victim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of ways attackers might gain access to your website. For instance, if you use the same credentials for other accounts, they might be revealed during a data breach. Using outdated plugins, themes, or old versions of WordPress can also lead to vulnerabilities on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your website grows in popularity, it can become a bigger target for competitors who are willing to use black hat SEO tactics. That’s why we recommend <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prioritizing WordPress security</a> from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to know if your WordPress website has been affected</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although spam attacks are typically obvious, you might miss them if you’re not paying close attention or are busy with other tasks. In this section, we’ll discuss several ways you can figure out if your site has been the target of an SEO spam attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. You find keywords and links you didn’t place</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you run a website, you become intimately familiar with its content. You probably remember every keyword and link you placed while working on a page or post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you’re checking out your website and you encounter content or links that you didn’t put there, you might be the victim of an SEO attack. This may be more difficult to determine if you have multiple team members with editing permissions, but when these keywords and links are unrelated to your usual content, it’s easy to spot them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. You see pages, posts, and ads that you didn’t set up</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you come across a page or post on your website that you or your teammates didn’t<em> </em>set up, that can be a clear sign of an SEO attack. To verify this, look to see if the page contains spammy keywords or links to suspicious websites. On the same note, if you suddenly start seeing ads on your site that you didn’t authorize, your website was likely breached.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. You notice sudden changes in traffic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many factors that can cause sudden changes in your website’s traffic —&nbsp;seasonality, new competitors, or even search engine algorithm updates. And since SEO spam negatively affects your rankings, this can often translate to a sharp drop in visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice an abrupt change, you might want to take a closer look at your website’s data. You can use tools like <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Analytics</a> paired with <a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Search Console</a> to see if these drops have anything to do with security issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. You get warnings from Google</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have run across the occasional website that <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2022/01/06/how-to-remove-your-site-from-googles-blacklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">displays a security warning</a> when you try to access it. That’s because Google is very proactive about signaling to users when a site may be dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>SEO spam is one of the reasons you might end up on Google’s blocklist and receive this warning. Visitors can still access your site, but that warning will likely scare off the vast majority of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. You receive messages from Google Search Console</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Search Console can notify you of a breach and identify instances of URL and content injection, as well as deceptive pages on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is possibly the best tool for identifying SEO spam. If you check the security report for your site often, you’ll be able to spot any issues before they become serious. Ideally, the Search Console security report should look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Without the right tools, by the time you identify SEO spam, chances are that your website is already being penalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to remove SEO spam from your WordPress website</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know you’re the victim of an SEO spam attack, you’d be wise to fix the problem before it seriously harms your site’s rankings. Let’s explore some different approaches you can take, depending on the type of damage you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Remove spam links, keywords, and pages manually</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress makes it easy to both publish and edit posts and pages. That means you can also delete entire pages and posts in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run across spam posts or pages, your best bet is to delete them immediately. If someone injected links into existing legitimate content, you can also remove them manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to use <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/posts/revisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress revisions</a> to return hacked posts or pages to previous versions. That is a bit less time-intensive if you have previous copies available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are simple processes, but they’re very prone to human error.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines <em>should</em> remove deleted pages automatically, but you can also do so manually to speed up the process. If you use Search Console, you can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9689846?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">use the <em>Removals </em>tool</a> to tell Google not to show specific pages in its results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Use Jetpack to identify suspicious behavior and restore backups</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jetpack’s WordPress security tool</a> includes an activity log so you can track everything that happens on your website, including updates to its content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be able to spot updates that you didn’t make to the site — a dead giveaway of unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest solution to an SEO spam attack is to <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/11/30/how-to-restore-a-wordpress-website-from-a-backup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">restore a backup</a> to a previous version. In your activity log, find the time that your page or post was edited, then simply restore a backup to the moment right before that happened. Since all of Jetpack’s backups are real-time, you’ll be able to get super granular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve restored the backup, make sure to update your account credentials in case they were compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Use Akismet to identify and remove spam comments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be more proactive, the Akismet plugin is the best way to <a href=\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/01/12/how-to-stop-comment-spam-in-wordpress/\">protect against spam comments</a>. You can set it to delete spam comments automatically or hold them for manual approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If attackers have access to the backend of your site, they might manually approve comments themselves. In that case, you’ll need to check the <em>Approved </em>queue for comments that look like spam. Our recommendation is to keep an eye out for ones that include links, are poorly written, or are irrelevant to the post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Run security scans for link injections</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some SEO spam attacks are more sophisticated than others. There are <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/11/hidden-seo-spam-link-injections-on-wordpress-sites.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forms of link injection</a> that alter links specifically for search engine crawlers, rather than ones that humans can visibly see. This type of SEO spam can go undetected even if you pay close attention to your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to spot code injections on your website is to use a WordPress security plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sucuri</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you install and activate Sucuri, go to <strong>Sucuri Security → Dashboard</strong><em> </em>in the WordPress admin dashboard. There, you can check to see if there are any security issues with your site. Sucuri will provide a report showing any instances of SEO spam, as well as any additional safety concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that Sucuri serves two purposes. It helps you identify security issues and aids you<em> </em>in protecting against them, but it cannot reverse any damage that has already been done. If the plugin finds instances of SEO spam, you’ll need to deal with them yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to protect your website against future SEO spam attacks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixing your website after an SEO spam attack can be very time-consuming. If the attack goes on for a while, you’ll also have to deal with the hit to your search engine rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s better, of course, to not let it happen at all. Here’s how to prevent SEO spam attacks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Update WordPress regularly. </strong>If you frequently update your WordPress version, as well as your plugins and themes, you drastically reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities on your site.</li><li><strong>Scan your website for SEO spam. </strong>You can use WordPress security plugins, like Sucuri, to scan your website for instances of SEO spam.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use a security plugin that prevents brute force attacks. </strong>Some security plugins, like Jetpack, include <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/security/brute-force-attack-protection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">brute force prevention tools</a>. This helps protect your site against hackers repeatedly trying to log into your site.</li><li><strong>Use Akismet to protect against comment spam. </strong><a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> automatically prevents spam comments from going public on your site. It can even get rid of the worst spam without you ever having to see it.</li><li><strong>Use a web application firewall. </strong>Some security plugins also include web application firewalls that can block suspicious connections to your website. If you use <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">managed WordPress hosting</a>, you probably also have access to this functionality.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting your website against SEO spam attacks is easier than you might imagine. If you’re working on a new website, we recommend that you take the time to prioritize security from the start. That way, you reduce the chances of having to deal with SEO spam attacks later on. But it’s never too late to put these practices in place and protect your site and reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Safeguard your WordPress website against SEO spam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many types of SEO spam attacks, including keyword stuffing, link injections, and server infiltration. Fortunately, there are also a lot of ways to safeguard your website against these threats, including using plugins like <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jetpack</a> and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no reason spam should take over your WordPress website. With Akismet, you can protect your website from comment spam and ensure that attackers don’t share links you don’t approve of!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 14:06:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Simon Keating\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Announces Marketplace Vision, Plans To Partner With Developers in the WordPress Ecosystem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=131106\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-announces-marketplace-vision-and-plan-to-partner-with-developers-in-the-wordpress-ecosystem\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5093:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Donna Cavalier announced the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/03/08/the-future-of-plugin-themes-and-services-purchases-on-wordpress-com/\">vision of WordPress.com&#8217;s marketplace</a> earlier today via the site&#8217;s news blog. This future will include bringing more premium themes, plugins, and services to users. Automattic, the company behind the site, will be partnering with third-party developers to bring these commercial offerings to its customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin developers, theme designers, and WordPress service providers can get on the early-access list by filling out the form on the announcement post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late January, WordPress.com announced a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/01/27/paid-plugins-available-directly-on-wordpress-com/\">limited, in-house plugin marketplace</a>. This was the testing ground before opening the gate to others. The launch included six WooCommerce extensions and has since grown to eight. The pricing plans range from $4 to $21 monthly and $44 to $224 annually, depending on which plugin is purchased.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Premium plugins on WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n<p>Users must currently be on a Business or eCommerce plan to install plugins. If paid annually, these plans run $300 and $540, respectively. For some users, the addition of commercial plugins will be out of reach unless WordPress.com opens this to the lower-priced Premium or Personal tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic CEO and WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/01/27/paid-plugins-available-directly-on-wordpress-com/#comment-421423\">commented on the January announcement</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We’ll definitely open up this program more in the future, first with a few top premium plugins to beta test things including payments and tracking, and then will open it up more to whoever wants to be a part of it.</p><p>We’ve got about 2 million people with saved payment details that we can make it one-click easy to folks to upgrade, so hopefully this represents a big new potential audience and customer base for people selling things in the WP ecosystem. And of course, we will prioritize working with developers and companies who participate in Five for the Future and contribute back to the WP community.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A built-in audience of 2 million users will likely entice many developers within the ecosystem. This could be a boon for those looking to grow their audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the devil is always in the details. The announcement did not include the finer points, such as the profit split and what might be a rigorous process, judging by the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/wordpress-com-marketplace/\">Marketplace Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By prioritizing those who contribute to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a> (5ftF), WordPress.com may limit the pool to companies who can afford to put time back into the open-source WordPress project. This could put smaller companies or new developers in the space at a disadvantage. Some just need help getting a foot in the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5ftF is an initiative that encourages organizations to contribute five percent of their resources to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program also only recognizes hours contributed via a Make Team. There are no other selectable options via the Contribution tab on WordPress.org profiles. Hours spent developing free plugins, themes, and alternative ways to give back to the community go uncounted. These types of contributions can easily extend beyond 5% of a developer or company&#8217;s time or resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />5ftF pledge form on WordPress.org.\n\n\n\n<p>There is also an issue of fake and dormant 5ftF pledges. Andrea Middleton <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2021/09/10/suggested-iterations-for-the-five-for-the-future-program-and-tool/\">noted in a post last August</a> that this has been a problem since the system was put in place in 2019:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The program runs on the honor system, and it wasn’t clear how much of a risk that would be, at launch. Two years later, there have certainly been more “spam” pledges than anyone would want, and surprisingly (to me) few reports of fake or spam pledges. What that tells me = either people don’t go surfing around in the pledge lists, checking for accuracy, the Report feature is too hard to find (unlikely), or people don’t really care whether pledges are accurate or not.</p><p>I do think that a substantial number of false/fake/spam pledges are a problem, because they depreciate the value of the sincere/active/real pledges. If we never intend to clean up the rolls, then we should probably consider shutting down the program or putting more disclaimers on the site.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ian Dunn, a WordPress contributor via Automattic, opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future/issues/169\">tracking ticket on GitHub</a> to clean up inaccurate pledges four days ago.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 02:06:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"WPTavern: WordPress Performance Team Releases New Feature Plugin For Testing Improvements In Progress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=131032\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-team-releases-new-feature-plugin-for-testing-improvements-in-progress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3907:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; performance team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/07/the-performance-lab-plugin-has-been-released/\">released</a> a new feature plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> that includes a set of performance-related improvements for core. The team, which formed just five months ago, is led by Yoast and Google-sponsored core contributors, and has had more than 250 people join its Slack channel, with many participating regularly in weekly chats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This first release includes the following modules, which are in varying states of development:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BModule%5D+WebP+Uploads%22\">WebP Uploads</a>:</strong> Creates WebP versions for new JPEG image uploads if supported by the server</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BModule%5D+WebP+Support%22\">WebP Support</a>:</strong> Adds a WebP support check in Site Health status</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BModule%5D+Persistent+Object+Cache+Health+Check%22\">Persistent Object Cache Health Check</a>:</strong> Adds a persistent object cache check for sites with non-trivial amounts of data in Site Health status</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BModule%5D+Audit+Enqueued+Assets%22\">Audit Enqueued Assets (experimental)</a>:</strong> Adds a CSS and JS resource check in Site Health status</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of the plugin is to make it easy for users to test improvements in progress. Each of these modules can be enabled or disabled under a new Settings > Performance menu in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WebP upload module can be tested by uploading JPEG images and then checking to see that the WebP versions are generated in the Media Library and displayed on the frontend. The other performance modules are checks that will show up on the Site Health status screen:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Core Committer Felix Arntz emphasized that the plugin should be considered a beta testing plugin, not a quick fix for making your WordPress site faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The plugin is not going to be a suite of all crucial performance features you need to make your site fast &#8211; that&#8217;s where the existing performance plugins have their market, and the Performance Lab plugin should indeed not falsely raise an impression of wanting to compete with them,&#8221; Arntz commented in a GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/144\">ticket</a> regarding the plugin&#8217;s branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users should be aware they may have unexpected results when testing the plugin, especially when enabling the more experimental features that are not turned on by default. It should not be considered a replacement for other more established performance plugins. Performance Lab may also change over time, as new features are proposed for core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because the Performance Lab plugin is a collection of potential WordPress core feature modules, the list of modules included may drastically change over time,&#8221; Arntz said. &#8220;New modules may be added regularly, while other modules may be removed in a future plugin version once they have landed in a WordPress core release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal for the feature plugin is to get performance improvements in progress tested more widely, weeding out edge cases before shipping the modules in a core release.

The site&#8217;s goal is to showcase creative uses of blocks and inspire the WordPress community to push the limits of what is possible with the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site showcases 22 pieces of block art from 11 people in the WordPress space. Ann McCarthy, Tammie Lister, Beatriz Fialho, Allan Cole, Rich Tabor, Nick Hamze, Brian Gardner, Javier Arce, Mel Choyce-Dwan, Channing Ritter, and Francisco Vera all contributed to this first outing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Multiple block art styles.\n\n\n\n<p>The concept builds upon an earlier project by Lister. <a href=\"https://ephemeralthemes.com/2021/10/01/a-block-pattern-a-day/\">In October 2021</a>, she announced <a href=\"http://patternspiration.com/\">Patternspiration</a>, a site where she created and released a new block pattern every day for the entire month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She was showing me those, sharing problems she was running into, the intent around &#8216;how quickly can I create a pattern/what can I create in 30 minutes per day,&#8217; etc.,&#8221; said McCarthy. &#8220;I brought it up on a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/10/20/hallway-hangout-5-9-go-no-go-site-editor-ia-and-more/\">hallway hangout</a>, and the idea just hit me as we were chatting (that&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep7mcBaeCsI&t=497s&ab_channel=WordPressHallwayHangouts\">moment in the video</a>). I found her approach to be so beyond creative and beautiful compared to some of the necessarily practical items in the block pattern directory.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">pattern directory</a> on WordPress.org must take a lot of factors into consideration to ensure patterns work across themes for millions of users. This limits what designers can do. However, such limitations are unnecessary on third-party sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to take it a step further because it felt so compelling to look at something and not have an &#8216;I bet that was made with WordPress&#8217; feeling that many of us have had,&#8221; said McCarthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Museum of Block Art allows for more artistry in its showcase, it can also create inconsistent results if end-users blindly copy/paste the code. For example, one of my favorite patterns is the <a href=\"https://block-museum.com/2022/02/02/its-me/\">It&#8217;s Me</a> (Super Mario) design by Hamze, which brings back at least a decade of childhood memories:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Super Mario block art.\n\n\n\n<p>However, it relies on color names that are not likely to exist in every theme. Copying the pattern code and pasting it into the editor should create the correct layout, but the colors might be off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other patterns require users to download the correct images and add them to their posts. <a href=\"https://block-museum.com/2022/02/17/abstractions-study-no-8/\">Abstractions Study No.8</a> by Cole relies on custom CSS, which is provided via a downloadable Blockbase child theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Abstract block art.\n\n\n\n<p>This sort of hodge-podge of methods is OK for a project like this. The goal is to inspire, not necessarily to make downloadable patterns. When designers experiment and push the boundaries, it can also help evolve the block system&#8217;s tools as they report limitations upstream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from Lister&#8217;s Patternspiration work, I had caught Ritter&#8217;s blog post in January <a href=\"https://critterverse.blog/2022/01/24/creating-block-art-with-wordpress-5-9/\">sharing how she had created block art</a>. At the time, I was unaware that it would be a part of the then-unknown Museum of Block Art project.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://block-museum.com/2022/01/26/city-textures/\">City Textures</a> block art.\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy added that she encouraged Ritter to publish the post, noting that it helps to &#8220;demystify&#8221; how it was done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I started pinging people who I thought would be interested in doing it,&#8221; said McCarthy of the block art included on the site. &#8220;It was all very grassroots and sometimes would just randomly come up in conversation. I tried to keep the ask very small since so much is going in with WordPress and the world. Probably less than half of the people I contacted actually submitted art pieces.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial plan was to launch the site alongside the WordPress 5.9 release. However, it was pushed back as contributors needed more time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no submission form for third-party contributions to the museum. However, McCarthy encourages designers to use the <code>#WPBlockArt</code> hashtag across social media to share their work. It could get picked up for inclusion on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mainly looking for pieces via the hashtag, but if I see a big demand for folks wanting to submit, I&#8217;d be game to open up something more official,&#8221; said McCarthy. &#8220;This has been a side project on top of 5.9, the FSE Outreach program, etc., so I wanted to be mindful about the opportunity cost of sinking more time into an off-the-wall idea.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 02:07:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Gutenberg Times: Introducing the Museum of Block Art (MOBA)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=20583\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/introducing-the-museum-of-block-art-moba/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3575:\"<p><strong>Introducing the Museum of Block Art</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing the <a href=\"https://block-museum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Museum of Block Art</a> (MOBA), a new project from WordPress community members that seeks to inspire creativity and push the limits around what can be done with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://block-museum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"gb-button gb-button-shape-rounded gb-button-size-medium\">Explore the Museum</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the art curated here is built using the block editor thanks to design tools that have come over the last few releases from border support to gradients and more.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will discuss Gutenberg 12.7 release, the new call for testing and the web fonts API arrived. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, and I&#8217;m here with my co-host Mary Job, WordPress advocate and support engineer at Paid Memberships Pro. Good afternoon, Mary. How are you doing today? Well, it&#8217;s actually good evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s actually good evening. It&#8217;s 7:30 PM right now over here in Nigeria. I am doing great, thank you very much, Birgit. This is officially my first show with you alone without Greg so I&#8217;m looking forward to this today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I hope we have all the technical issues that we seemed to have for the last episode of it, figured out. And I apologize that we didn&#8217;t get it sooner. So, Mary Job now that you are here and be on this journey with me, you have such a big influence on WordPress, and I hope that you can tell listeners more about you so they get to know you a little bit more. So first of all, where do you live and what do you do for a living?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Okay, awesome. So I live in the Southwestern part of Nigeria. It&#8217;s called Ijebu. It&#8217;s about an hour drive from Lagos if there&#8217;s no traffic. Of course if there&#8217;s traffic it might be three hours or four hours. I currently work with Paid Memberships Pro. It&#8217;s a membership plugin software, for WordPress, of course. And what else do I do? In my spare time I contribute to the community and I run a village where we teach young girls and women how to use computers and the internet and empower themselves. But lately we&#8217;re focusing on WordPress. That&#8217;s a little bit about me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that&#8217;s awesome. It kind of reminds me of when I started out working on digital literacy and internet and teaching people things, what they do and then also got into WordPress. So it seems to be, you&#8217;re the community organizer that I am per heart as well. So I&#8217;m so glad that we can do this together. So do you have family? I know you have a daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Ah, yes. I have one daughter and I have family. I&#8217;m a single mom, so I would say that we&#8217;re a family of two. That&#8217;s what I always say. She&#8217;s going to be 12. She can&#8217;t wait to be a teenager according to her, so good luck to me on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Well, thank you so much. How deep are you in working with Gutenberg on your websites and on your writing on blog posts, or are you Paid Membership Pro?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: So I have been using Gutenberg since it came out but I&#8217;m just diving deep into full site editing. The first time I did encounter full site editing, I was a little bit confused to be honest. I was like, okay, so what am I. Because the customizer was also going like, okay, what am I doing? This is going to take more time to get used to learn how to use. So we&#8217;re going to see how that goes. I&#8217;m going to be sharing my findings in future episodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Excellent. Excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, thank you for mentioning the full site editing program. Brings us right into our next topic is that Anne McCarthy has published a new call for testing out of the FSE, the full site editing program, and it&#8217;s called hyping headers. And it leads you through the revisiting of common workflows and you&#8217;re testing all the new tools to customize a header, including the navigation block and template parts, focus mode, and personalized header for different templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are some great instructions not only to test things, but this participating in that is definitely a good way to learn about FSE and the little details about it. So you get the testing environment set up and then testing instructions, and then Anne walks you through different tasks to accomplish. And then ask you a few questions. Like, did the experience crash at some point, did you find features missing? Did you especially enjoy or appreciate some of the experience and did it work using a keyboard only? Did it work using her screen reader? And the feedback deadline for that is March 16th. That&#8217;s about 12 days out. And then she will relay all your feedback to the developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to participate in it, we&#8217;ll have definitely the link in the show notes, or you go to make.wordpress.org/test. That is the second post on that, or just search for hyping headers with Anne McCarthy. The call for testing is also available in Italian, if it&#8217;s easier for you to participate in that within your own language, that link will also be shared in the show notes. So I think that will be a good way to start your own experience, Mary, to kind of follow through there. It&#8217;s also some guided so you don&#8217;t have to think, okay, what do I want to do now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Right, I totally agree with you. It&#8217;s a good way to start, because there are steps to follow. Literally just have to follow the steps and of course note the results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Note the results and then, you were breaking up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, I said it&#8217;s important to participate, because there are steps to follow. So it&#8217;s pretty straightforward for somebody who wants to participate, just have to follow the instructions and then note the results of your test and then share that with everyone to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And there were actually some, I don&#8217;t know if they do it for this call, but sometimes the GoDaddy Pro people around Courtney Robinson. They are also doing sometimes Google and Hangouts where they walk through the call for testing with a group of people. So people can follow along. Once we know about that, we will certainly have it in the weekend edition of the Gutenburg times. So another point I wanted to make is we are in March and we have two more Gutenburg, developer hours. Coming up one is on March 8th at 11:00 AM, Eastern 1600 UTC and on March 22nd at the same time. And that will then conclude the four-event trial for the Gutenburg developer hours. And then we will recap retrospect the events and see what we can do for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will go to extend the offering through the WordPress social learning spaces to also have Asia Pacific good times for the developer hours, and also maybe have different dates and days throughout the month where those, when those good work developer hours happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 12.7</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that is that. Now Gutenberg 12.7 was released this week, and there we will have in the show notes, the release notes from the make blog, as well as a link to the WP Tavern post. But before I go in there, there&#8217;s also a core editor improvement post on the make core blog about choosing your style, choosing a style that is a new feature in a good plugin, where you can have a selection of styles from your theme that changes the whole theme. The default theme, Twenty Twenty, allows that already. So you could, as a theme developer have two theme JS on files offering to your users and then styles, it has a new menu items as other styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you can switch between a, for instance, a black or white background with everything else changing as well, or as some of the demos for the 5.9 release showed was that you are all of the sudden have a more blue leaning Twenty Twenty Two theme or a more Red leaning. So there are some, a big improvements there, but also big new challenges and options for theme developers and on the core make blog, there&#8217;s a now called Tuesday styles. That gets you a little bit more information about that. All right. So now we get into what&#8217;s new in good book, 12.7, it was released on Wednesday, March 2nd, and it starts with enhancements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the enhancements people will have long waited for it that the columns block has now border support. And it shows up when you select the column block in the sidebar, you will be able to set borders, border radios, border colors or border strength. That is certainly something a lot of people have been waiting for is also something that quite a few block tools, additional plugins have provided for a long time. And now it&#8217;s actually in core. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah. The group blocks also have margin support added to the top and bottom. So that&#8217;s also a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You have now more control when you, on the margins there were always quite presets or defaults from the core block, but that you didn&#8217;t have as a user control over how big that was, you needed to get the, to CSS code to actually change it. So this is now in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: OK. The list for you has gotten a new enhancement and now you can have multi-select behavior for blocks. And when the shift key is selected, so you can select one block and the other block and then move them together for instance, or show them together. So there are quite a few additional we are handling. We are, there are just quality of life, so to speak enhancements. So this is definitely one for a power user. So the quick inserter has changed now a little bit, and it&#8217;s prioritizing patterns instead of blocks that when they&#8217;re available in the context of your semantic handling, I think it is, that was the one if you are looking for, and that is in the template editor or the site editor, not so much in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s part of the pattern and enhancements that we also get in other places you also show existing template parts, and the list of block patterns in the creation flow. That&#8217;s in the four template parts. So if you are editing a header, you also get in the inserter header patterns that come either with core or with the theme that you are using. So that&#8217;s definitely improvement and an enhancement for all those site building editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah. That saves you from having to search, because I know previously have to search most times I have to open the entire blocks and pattern and just be able to pick the one that I want for the team or for the pluggin that I&#8217;m working with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Exactly. Yeah you pass by all the other blocks and patterns until you find the one that is it&#8217;s much easier now to find things that you need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next part is the initial version of the style engine. There has been quite a few discussions around and I will mention one specifically, but the team is working on a unified kind of style engine to solve a few inconsistencies and to help theme developers to work with the CSS variables that come with the styles and also how to add their own styles without having to revamp it every time a new plugin comes out. And that is now possible because the post editor is fixed and the style editor and the site editor or template editor either way are now much more finalized. So now all the things that have changed in the last three years are now kind of settled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the solutions that were provided can now be kind of consolidated and standardized. And Mark Ru Wiley also has a proposal in the Gutenberg issues where he tackles that topic quite a bit and has a few suggestions on how to solve some of the issues. He also has a very good list of what the issues pain points actually are. So he defines the problem quite nicely and comprehensively. So it&#8217;s definitely worth a read for the same developers that are trying to get the head around full site editing with the block editor. And so that&#8217;s just as a side note, you will find the links all in the show note, I think we mentioned it also briefly in our last episode, in the 61 episode. So there is now a with this versioin, now also an initial work in progress of the styling part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of it is also the lowering, the specificity of alignment rules for supporting layouts to wide alignment. There was this catch 22, that if you wanted to have wider aligned blocks, like a cover block or a gallery block or full aligned, you needed to get to the edges of the browser. But if you don&#8217;t want the text answer, go to the end of the browser, you needed to have a margin on that. So it was kind of a catch 22 that you couldn&#8217;t use the wide alignment or the full alignment when you wanted to also have borders there. So there is a solution there, if it&#8217;s working for your theme, you&#8217;ll find out. And then speaking of themes, this release removes data alignment for the themes, its a port layout. So you might need to update your theme to adhere to that. And it&#8217;s also remove div wrappers for the aligned image blocks. So that will certainly also interrupt some of the themes when you are using it. But it&#8217;s a very simple adjustment, but I need to go through that. Mary, do you want to take the next one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. The patterns registration from directory with theme.json is not allowed. So want to write up on that, but those who are building patterns and teams, and then there&#8217;s also the list view. You can now expand block list three on selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah the expanding and collapsing of list three is really helpful when you have a long post or template that you need to organize there. Yeah. So let me go back to the allow pattern registration from directory, with the theme.json. So you can now I&#8217;ll put black pattern registration in a sub directory of your theme. And then in theme, Jason, you can link to those patterns through a setting to that directory. The team is also working on a method to actually include patterns from the WordPress directory and have them, that is that? Okay, sorry. So you use the slug from the pattern in the WordPress directory and add it to your theme.json. So it will be shown in your theme for the inserter as well. So that&#8217;s good. All right. That concludes all the enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were quite a few others that we kind of skipped over it, but because there were a little minor or hard to explain there, but the bug fixes are coming and coming, coming bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So every release has 20 to 40 bug fixes. And that is really cool how the community kind of reports bug fixes and the get up issues, and then the team to take them on and fix all the things that are, are not working just right, like the latest post block had a missing class for the Post title. So it was very hard for a theme to actually target the Post title for the block that has now been solved. Also the query block got a bug fix noting that when you only want to see sticky post, that nothing will be displayed. If there are no sticky posts. So there was some quirkiness there, but now it&#8217;s solved. The global style duo tone rendering was missing in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that seems to be a backport that will go into the next minor release of the WordPress core. So that is fixed and onset core. Earlier so you don&#8217;t have to wait to 6.0 to come out. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to accessibility updates that are together with a search button. Also the duplication labels for safe draft or saved as pending buttons have been avoided now. And then there is the rich text. There was a change in the rich text component, and that was reversed because it had an area multiline states, which of course doesn&#8217;t work that well. And then the tree grid for at home and end keys and up and to jump to the start and the end of the grid. So that&#8217;s really helpful for keyboard navigation. All right, this Gutenberg plugin also brings us new APIs to handle core data like post data or other records from custom post types, one meta tag, and it proposes two new experiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>PRs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One is the use entity records proposal, and then an experimental usage of that, which is a hook that you can use to handle data. And PRS actually have some example quote that you can use. And also what&#8217;s in and out of the scope of this PR. And so that is definitely neat. Your testing, now when you open up the Gutenberg plugin, there&#8217;s in the menu, in the WP admin, there is a sections called experiment. That&#8217;s previously where the navigation block and the patterns and other things that were in experiments and have now been released. Now, the newer experiments is all about the data. So you can have an easier way to use the core data store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And structure it&#8217;s definitely very developer centric, of course, and there are other considerations. So the experiments and the PRs have all the discussions in there, and it might be really helpful for community developers like agency developers or plugin developers to take a look at that and see what would be a way to solve these, or is there a need of any changes Adam Selinsky has done the experimental work there, the pioneer work to have the entity record hooks in there. So check it out. It&#8217;s a new API.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course the documentation has changed. Some of the handbook includes now all the additional information about the pattern fields for the theme.json also the contextual patterns and pattern transformations and the semantic pattern documentation. So there is definitely some reading materials for you over the weekend. So there&#8217;s one, if you are a developer who also wants to contribute in creating releases, there&#8217;s a new NPM package available now to automate the cherry picking to WordPress trunk commits during publishing. So there are some hiccups that were before that were manually solved are now automated. So that&#8217;s, this part also gets easier and easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. And I like that the release notes always also show now the first time contributors thank you for making the jump to contribute to WordPress Gutenberg, to the Gutenberg repo and Dave Smith. Also now solved has written the script to add all contributors to the end of the GitHub release notes for each Gutenberg plugin. So that&#8217;s also great. So people get recognition beyond the GitHub repo. So it&#8217;s in the WordPress make blog as well. All right. Anything else that stands out for you, Mary from this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No, not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Not at all. Good. So we covered everything that is good. I&#8217;m really excited about the multi block selection, the list view, and then margins reports for the group, of course, and the block transformation now retains classes. That&#8217;s certainly something and you can register patterns from the directory. So there are quite a few new features in there that make working with it much easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So Justin, so now can we come to the section of what&#8217;s discussed and Justin Tadlock from the WebPress from the WP Tavern has found that the word web funds API has finally arrived and historically it was punted from the WebPress 5.9 release just because it didn&#8217;t seem ready and needed a little bit more testing through a good more plugin releases instead of going right into 5.9. That&#8217;s the way to add web fonts to your web install and have a standardized API to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So not every plugin and every theme and every yeah, loads, additional web fonts, it all goes through this API and there is no duplication of that. And now you can also, it does not have a theme.json support yet, but that is right now, it&#8217;s only available through PHP. So you definitely need to look at that beforehand, for your theme, Aris Stratus, one of the developers, the initial road about the privacy issues that are there because Germany and some other countries are it&#8217;s about the Google font providers or providing Google fonts in, through a CDN that has some privacy issues there. And now it looks like that local fonts are officially supported, but theme and plugin authors must register the custom providers. So it&#8217;s getting, getting complicated. That&#8217;s a standardized API is really, really helpful for. So there are some privacy issues with the web funds from certain providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pull request has PHP examples somehow to do that, the theme.json keys and values are corresponding with the font phase rules and Justin Tadlock looked did a great job in putting all the details together in one post. So you don&#8217;t have to read through the make blog posts to find all the different details about it. And I&#8217;m sure the documentation team is working on that right now. You cannot do this now with 12.7, it&#8217;s slated for 12.8, or you can use the good work nightly from the good work times. Gutenburg nightly plugin that is always created from trunk. So it has the newest merged PRs in it. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the end of this good book change log. It&#8217;s a little shorter today and that&#8217;s sometimes a relief anyway for our listeners. And before the end of the show, I just wanted to remind everyone, March 8th and March 22nd, or the Gutenburg developer hours. And there is a call for testing called hyping headers. The number 12 call for testing for the full site editing program. Do you have anything that you want the people to know Mary?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No, not yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. So you survived the first episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. I feel like I have a lot to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, you also know a lot. And so as always, the show notes will be published on gutenburgtimes.com/podcast. gutenburgtimes.com/podcast. And this is number 62. And if you have questions or suggestions or news you want us to include, then send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a> that&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Email address, or just ping me or Mary on Twitter, private chat, or even on the public chat. So thank you, Mary, for being with me today and making the show with me and thank you all for listening. And I&#8217;ll talk to you in two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. Thank you. Be thank you everyone for this. And I&#8217;ll see again in two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Take care.

It allows users to insert a piano-based interface into the editor for playing music. Mostly, it is just a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamano <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/highlight-underline-and-control-font-size-with-richtext-extension\">launched  RichText Extension</a>, his first submission to the WordPress plugin directory, in the spring of 2020. At the time, block-related plugins were still scarce, but he has continued contributing extensions since that initial release. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-spacer-block/\">Flexible Spacer Block</a> is invaluable for responsive vertical spacing. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-table-block/\">Flexible Table</a> does the same for table elements, and his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-html-block-extension/\">Custom HTML Block Extension</a> is handy for anyone writing code regularly from the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While his previous outings covered several vital features for different user groups, his latest is a bit more on the lighter side of things. More than anything, it serves as a brief distraction, a way to break up the day for people who spend a lot of time in the WordPress content editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that I love about blocks is that they do not have to serve a vital function in producing content for a site. Sometimes, their purpose is to simply bring a little joy into our lives. That is what Piano Block does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamano noted in the plugin description:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This plugin does not add any useful features to WordPress, nor does it add any useful blocks to help you write posts. Let&#8217;s insert this block and enjoy the music if you are stuck in writing an article or just want a little distraction.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin merely adds a web-based musical instrument to the block editor, offering a change of pace from building content. It does not appear on the front end of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Piano Block in the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The block offers a range of 14 instruments. The default is an acoustic piano, but users can switch between various keyboard, string, brass, and woodwind options. Plus, there is a xylophone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can move up or down two octaves, change the volume, or toggle the sustain pedal on and off. Other than that, there are no other block-specific options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block&#8217;s keyboard mapping threw me off at first. I peeked under the hood and found the JavaScript code for assigning each key. I was tempted to clone the plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository, set up the build tools, and customize it. However, that seemed like a lot of work for a block meant to be a momentary distraction. It was not time for me to put on my developer hat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I tickled the plastic keys of my laptop, trying to rewire my brain to a layout that did not match an actual piano.  I just had fun with it, and that is kind of the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rarely record videos, being much more comfortable tapping my laptop&#8217;s keys than doing anything on camera. Therefore, Tavern visitors are in for something of a treat today. I put together a short clip of me playing a song via the Piano Block:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>That was tougher than it looked with the keys in odd places. Apologies if I missed any notes or lines. It has been a while since I have heard <em>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</em>. I believe it goes a little something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am continually amazed at what some developers create on top of the block system.  More than anything, I want to see some of the talented musicians in the WordPress community &#8212; I know some of you are out there &#8212; record themselves playing something with Piano Block.  <em>A little jazz, perhaps?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/piano-block/\">Piano Block</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 05 Mar 2022 01:03:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.0 to Introduce Performance Improvements for Custom Pages\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=130920\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-0-to-introduce-performance-improvements-for-custom-pages\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2910:\"<p>WordPress core committer Jonny  Harris <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10886?utm_source=Post+Status+Newsletter&utm_campaign=c4852581a1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_01_27_08_35_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_afc03177a6-c4852581a1-104953921&mc_cid=c4852581a1&mc_eid=ad602f9b49#comment:39\">merged a patch</a> into WordPress core for a 12-year-old <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10886\">ticket</a> that he says has the potential to bring &#8220;a massive effect on performance for custom pages.&#8221; The change, which will be included in the upcoming 6.0 release, stops unnecessary queries when developers are using the&nbsp;<code>do_parse_request</code>&nbsp;filter, thanks to a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/2032\">refreshed patch</a> from contributor Paul Bearne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harris summarized the problem and how the change improves performance in the commit message:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Developers of plugins and themes can use the&nbsp;<code>do_parse_request</code>&nbsp;filter to hot-wire requests and hook in early to render custom pages. However, even through these request may not need post queries and 404 lookups to be run, they run anyway. This can results in unnecessary SQL queries running on these requests.

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt. My friends, there are links in the show notes to some of the groups that Matt referenced. And that is it for this special edition of the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Be safe, be kind to yourself and others, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 21:39:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress – February 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12411\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/the-month-in-wordpress-february-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11736:\"<p>There’s a lot going on in the world right now, and safety is top of mind for everyone in the WordPress community.

Little did they know that a jammed printer would lead to the beginning of an era: the free software movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever heard the phrase, &#8220;free as in freedom, not beer,&#8221; this is what it means:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Free software&#8221; means software that respects users&#8217; freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, &#8220;free software&#8221; is a matter of liberty, not price.&nbsp;</p><cite>The <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html\">GNU Project</a> and Free Software Foundation</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Foundation&#8217;s philosophy requires that all projects and software we support be licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\">GNU Public License</a>, a free, copyleft license—this is intentional. If you mistakenly think open source has no place in business purely because there’s no monetary value attached to the software, we urge you to think again.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The path to innovation and progress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source software offers a low-cost entry to the market and paves an efficient way for innovation. These projects harness the power of diverse knowledge, skills, and community to create the best software. <strong>But what does this mean for businesses?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Companies who wish to create wealth are always interested in productivity. Productivity includes being able to innovate effectively [&#8230;] Effective innovation is not merely being able to invent and improve, but also being able to determine what to invent and how to improve,&#8221; said <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Innovation_Happens_Elsewhere/2VElII9QeakC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover\">Richard P. Gabriel and Ron Goldman</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most individuals recognize Apple as an innovative and successful technology company. However, few people outside the developer community may know MacOS X was based on <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/01/explore-some-of-the-most-memorable-moments-in-wwdc-history-as-we-approach-apples-32nd-conference/\">Darwin</a>, an open source project. Many of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/opensource/\">Apple’s platforms</a> draw inspiration from open source, and plenty of other companies have done the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With open source software, organizations have access to the latest updates and bug fixes, thanks to frequent and reliable releases. Put simply, building on that existing work rather than reinventing the wheel puts them on the fastest path to creating a better product for their customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, business strategies based on open source can level the playing field. Small organizations that rely on open source projects for their products can leverage ubiquity to build brand equity, as Gabriel and Goldman explain. This makes the companies more trustworthy to the customer, allowing them to compete fairly with organizations with extensive resources. There’s also a low risk of the software being discontinued and affecting the business. Even if the original programmers leave the project, the maintenance and development of open source software will go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re only scratching the surface of how open source software is good for business. The reality is that the work done in open source projects benefits the society at large—they help create a better world through technology. The best way businesses can support that future is by adopting open source technologies and contributing to such projects.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 16:51:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Anjana Vasan\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Post Status: Post Status Notes #488\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=94063\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-notes-488/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12431:\"<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Core releases.

This release is not as feature-heavy as the last, but it feels solid overall. Other than one breaking issue, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/02/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12-7-2-march/\">version 12.7</a> includes several nice-to-have enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest update includes some early work for a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37978\">new style engine</a>. This is a longer-term project that should improve saving and rendering block styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The template and site editors should <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38709\">surface patterns</a> over blocks in the quick inserter under certain conditions, such as at the root level of a template. However, I was unable to see this in action. I may need to refresh my install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Columns block also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31737\">supports border</a> width, style, color, and radius options. I look forward to this eventually being the case for all blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"multi-select-in-list-view\">Multi-Select in List View</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting multiple blocks in the list view.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38314\">select multiple blocks</a> in the list view when the <code>Shift</code> key is selected.  Once holding the key, users can use the mouse to click on others, adding or removing them.  The up/down arrow keys are an alternative to using the mouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enhancement also allows users to drag and drop the selected group of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"broken-images\">Broken Images</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Image from pattern not responsive.\n\n\n\n<p>I let my guard down. I became comfortable with WordPress and Gutenberg handling some of that foundational CSS work I had always included in past themes. Things seemed to be going so well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gutenberg, you and I had a sweet streak going where you did not break anything.</em> Now, it is time to reset the ol&#8217; &#8220;releases without incident&#8221; counter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, the default block library stylesheet provided baseline responsive styles for images. That <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39045\">CSS now only targets</a> <code>&lt;img></code> tags if they include <code>wp-image-</code> in a class. This is particularly problematic for images in some block patterns. The case may be the same for other image instances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous selector was overly broad and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39021\">broke images in third-party plugins</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best course of action is for theme authors to include the following CSS for images:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>img {\n    max-width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"group-block-margins\">Group Block Margins</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding extra top margin to a Group block.\n\n\n\n<p>Customizing margins is almost synonymous with the term &#8220;web design.&#8221; The Group block &#8212; the flagship container &#8212; has lacked support for margin control until now. Some have gotten around this limitation by using a Spacer, but it only increases the space between blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most issues have been around reducing margins. Theme designers have often needed to employ workarounds, a problem Nick Diego <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37344\">mentioned in the ticket</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Theme developers (myself included) are resorting to &#8220;magic classes&#8221; to zero out, or modify, margins on blocks. Allowing themes to opt-in to Group margin support will provide greater flexibility and decrease the reliance on custom CSS/classes in the theme&#8217;s stylesheet.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Margin support is still missing for many other blocks, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37300\">including paragraphs</a>. Users can always wrap them within a Group and modify it for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-transformations-maintain-classes\">Block Transformations Maintain Classes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom block style class maintained when transforming a block.\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-12-6-enhances-transforming-blocks-adds-read-more-and-post-author-bio-blocks-and-enables-social-icon-labels\">Gutenberg 12.6</a>, released two weeks ago, saw much work on improving the block transforms, a feature that allows users to switch one block to another. One of the primary improvements in the previous update included maintaining font size and color options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 12.7 adds custom <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38964\">CSS classes to the mix</a>. This includes those users added manually and those added by the custom block styles mechanism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upside of maintaining custom block style classes is that the new block keeps the selected style if supported. The downside is that it becomes a junk class if not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still some missing options that I would like to see maintained through transforming text-based blocks. In particular, keeping the text alignment the same would help with my workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"themes-can-register-patterns-from-the-directory\">Themes Can Register Patterns from the Directory</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a registered pattern into the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 12.7 allows theme authors to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38323\">load patterns</a> from the WordPress.org pattern directory for their users. Those added will appear in their respective categories in the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, there is no method for highlighting the selected patterns, and they will only appear based on the order they were registered. Unfortunately, featured patterns from WordPress.org appear higher on the list, even if they were not selected by the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a solid first iteration. Getting it in now will allow theme authors to provide feedback and contributors to build upon the foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>theme.json</code> how-to guide includes new <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#patterns\">documentation for registering these patterns</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alignment-wrappers-removed\">Alignment Wrappers Removed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no secret that I am a block fanboy. However, there has been one longstanding issue that has almost made me want to ditch the system. Actually, I quit developing a free block theme altogether last year in large part because of this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 12.7 removes the extra <code>&lt;div></code> <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/38613\">wrapper for wide and full-width blocks</a> in the editor, at least for themes that support the layout feature. This wrapper element created a conflict between the back and front-end designs previously. In some cases, theme authors couldn&#8217;t style them consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a theme author wanted to give extra spacing to a sibling block (one that follows another), it was impossible to target it in the editor with CSS. The additional wrapper meant they were no longer siblings in the document structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more recent <code>blockGap</code> feature, introduced in WordPress 5.9, alleviated spacing-related issues to some degree. It was enough relief to tolerate the broken system, knowing that some designs were still impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today marks the start of a new world of possibilities for designers. This is one roadblock I am happy to see left behind. For the most part, I just want to revisit and implement several old ideas.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 02:28:29

Russia is decimating Ukrainian cities in an unlawful attempt to occupy the country, WordPress companies and individuals are seeking ways to help refugees fleeing the violence, as well as those who have stayed behind to fight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are living in one of those rare times in history where events have captured the attention and hearts of people around the world, with a powerful unifying force. In the face of such unmitigated hostility and injustice, many feel helpless to make a difference, but the WordPress community is finding creative ways to support the brave efforts of the Ukrainian people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After identifying an attack on Ukrainian universities&#8217; websites that coincided with Russia&#8217;s invasion, Wordfence <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/03/ukraine-universities-hacked-by-brazilian-via-finland-as-russian-invasion-started/\">announced</a> it has enabled its real-time threat intelligence for more than 8,000 of its users on the Ukrainian .UA top-level domain (TLD) until further notice. Ordinarily, this is a paid feature. It includes a commercial-grade IP blocklist, real-time firewall rules, and real-time malware detection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is the first time in the history of our company that we are taking this action,&#8221; Defiant (makers of Wordfence) CEO Mark Maunder said. &#8220;We are doing it as a response to the crisis that has unfolded in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://servebolt.com/\">Servebolt</a>, a company that hosts WordPress sites, among other platforms, has offered free hosting to anyone working to help the Ukrainian people.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These are troubled times for the people of  the Ukraine. The Ukrainian people need all the help they can get and we like to do our part.<br /><br />We’re offering for free hosting to anyone working to help out the Ukrainian people. <br /><br />Reach out to us via DM and we’ll help you set things up.</p>&mdash; Servebolt.com (@servebolt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/servebolt/status/1498303033578602497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 28, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p> In one extraordinary individual effort that raised €3500, mainly from the WordPress community, Ines van Dijk, a mother of three, living in the Netherlands, drove 2500 km to Poland to donate items and chauffeur refugees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Many, many people have been displaced&#8221;, she said. &#8220;I am unable to sit with that quietly and do nothing, so I decided to rent a van, load it up with things refugees might need, and drive to Poland.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>She collected bags of clothing and blankets, personal items, bought food and water, and transported it to refugees in Poland.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>One week after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, more than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-joe-biden-kyiv-1b396834ff3e753f8953d86c8db85383\">a million people have fled the country</a> in what the United Nations is calling the swiftest refugee exodus this century. Meanwhile, many have chosen to stay behind and some Ukraine-based companies are struggling to stay in business while sheltering for their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/\">Crocoblock</a>, a company with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/crocoblock/\">plugins on WordPress.org</a> as well as commercial products, is made up of a 40+ person team of Ukrainians.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our team is located in three cities (Mykolaiv, Lviv, Kyiv),&#8221; Crocoblock Partner Manager Lana Miro said in an update on Post Status Slack. &#8220;We are safe, working somehow. Some stay in basements, some stay in apartments (and use the bathroom during air alarms). Our mood is optimistic and we believe/help our army. Thanks everyone for your support and everything will be fine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crocoblock has updated the banner on its site, which links to a <a href=\"https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/\">donation page for the Ukrainian Army</a>. The banner references the last words of Ukrainian soldiers who were believed to have died defending Snake Island in the Black Sea. They may have been illegally captured by Putin&#8217;s forces but this has not yet been confirmed. Their brave last words have become a rallying cry, echoing the sentiments of pro-Ukrainian supporters around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Paid Memberships Pro CEO Jason Coleman has written a tutorial on <a href=\"https://therealjasoncoleman.com/2022/03/02/heres-one-way-internet-businesses-of-any-kind-can-help-ukrainians-now/\">how internet businesses can find their Ukrainian customers</a> and email them to see how they can be of help. There are specific instructions in the article for those using the PMPro plugin can on how they can find users with a Ukrainian billing address, Ukrainian email addresses, or Ukrainian websites. It is also more broadly applicable to those using other CRM or e-commerce software solutions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team at Codeable, a WordPress freelancer platform, is also working with its developers in Ukraine and Russia to support them in ensuring their clients still receive services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are a two sided marketplace between our developers and clients,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.codeable.io/\">Codeable</a> Expert Community Development Lead Mike Demo said. &#8220;We are doing daily wellness checks, expedited payouts to our developers in Ukraine and Russia, and helping clients with Ukraine and Russian experts find alternative development help if needed at no cost to the client or money lost for the expert.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, Namecheap took a highly controversial approach to making a difference, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30504812\">terminating service for Russian customers</a> with just six days&#8217; notice. (Namecheap has since revised the deadline to March 22). This includes Namecheap Hosting, EasyWP (Namecheap&#8217;s managed WordPress hosting), and Private Email with a domain provided by another registrar in zones .ru, .xn--p1ai (рф), .by, .xn--90ais (бел), and .su. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The email to customers puts the onus on subjects of authoritarian rule, a tactic that sparked a fiery debate on Hacker News:  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Unfortunately, due to the Russian regime’s war crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine, we will no longer be providing services to users registered in Russia. While we sympathize that this war may not affect your own views or opinion on the matter, the fact is, your authoritarian government is committing human rights abuses and engaging in war crimes so this is a policy decision we have made and will stand by.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As sanctions are having a catastrophic effect on the Russian economy, and many Russians are scrambling to get out of the country, some contend that these measures are hurtful to those who are trying to help. One user on Hacker News, @_vtoj, highlighted <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30507142\">a few reasons</a> why this approach is problematic:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Dude, right now all of us are in deep shock, while:</p><p>&#8211; some are trying to find their relatives in Ukraine</p><p>&#8211; some are coordinating and volunteering</p><p>&#8211; some are trying to get themselves and their families outside of Russia (which gets harder by the minute because of prices and sanctions)</p><p>&#8211; some are trying to smuggle at least some of the money outside, because their entire life savings are now blocked</p><p>&#8211; some are trying to preserve what they have despite ruble and market crashing</p><p>&#8211; some are hunkering down with what they have and their loved ones, trying to stockpile some food before prices skyrocket</p><p>And no one has any time to cope and process anything &#8211; don&#8217;t forget usual workloads, too. Planning for a week feels like it&#8217;s already a strategic, not a tactical scope.</p><p>I get what you&#8217;re trying to do, but can&#8217;t you at least give more time for everyone? Right now I need to drop everything and migrate my DNS as well because my private email that I use for docs will stop working in 6 days. And to figure out how to pay the transfer fees while doing all that. It&#8217;s very much fucking stressful already.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy, another major domain registrar and host, took a slightly different approach, <a href=\"https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/company-news/news-details/2022/How-GoDaddy-is-Supporting-Ukrainian-Customers/default.aspx\">announcing</a> today that the company is renewing, at no cost, any products or services that are set to expire in the next 60 days for Ukrainian customers. The company is also donating $500,000 to humanitarian relief in Ukraine and matching donations from employees, and providing assistance for Ukrainian contract workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened in Ukraine is horrible,&#8221; GoDaddy said. &#8220;We do not condone the unwarranted aggression from the Russian Government.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is also making specific business decision that impact Russian customers but may not affect existing customers as strongly as the Namecheap&#8217;s sanctions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Removing the Russian version of our website&nbsp;</li><li>No longer supporting new registrations of .ru and .ru.com</li><li>Removing all .ru domain names from our domain name aftermarket</li><li>Removing the Russian Ruble</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress managed host WP Engine is donating to <a href=\"https://www.pah.org.pl/\">Polish Humanitarian Action</a> and the <a href=\"https://crisisrelief.un.org/t/ukraine\">Ukraine Humanitarian Fund</a>, as well as matching employee donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for ideas on where you can lend your support, longtime WordPress contributor and the co-organizer of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kyiv-ukraine-to-host-its-first-official-wordcamp-in-september-2016\">first official WordCamp in Ukraine</a>, Andrey Savchenko, recommends donating to the <a href=\"https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi\">Ukrainian Armed Forces</a> and <a href=\"https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/\">Come Back Alive fund</a>.

The <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/02/28/woocommerce-6-3-rc-2/\">second release candidate for 6.3</a> dropped as we near the March 8th final release. In RC2, WooCommerce Admin has been updated from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1 — the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/blob/main/changelog.txt\">changelog is available here</a>. Two <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/02/22/woocommerce-6-2-1-security-fix/\">security fixes</a> addressed the permission check for reviews in v1 & v2 REST API and Path Traversal in Importers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/03/01/woocommerce-blocks-7-1-0-release-notes/\">WooCommerce Blocks 7.1.0</a> came out with Global Styles support for more blocks and improved editor capabilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"guidelines-for-adding-actions-and-filters\">Guidelines for Adding Actions and Filters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>New <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/03/01/adding-and-modifying-actions-and-filters/\">guidelines for adding and modifying actions and filters</a> are available on GitHub in the WooCommerce project Wiki. The guidelines bring clarity to the kinds of changes that are acceptable &#8220;and to reduce unnecessary back-and-forth during the code review process.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-editor-passes-the-twelve-year-old-test\">Block Editor Passes the Twelve-Year-Old Test</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a chance to <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/writer-developer-woocommerce-builder/\">chat with developer and writer Eric Karkovack</a> about Woo and a lot more. Eric shared some insights around the challenges facing WooCommerce site-builders by being a bit too &#8220;piecemeal.&#8221; Eric also talks about his experience with Gutenberg and clients\' reactions to it, as well as his 12-year-old daughter as he helped her set up her own site:  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;In fact, I set my daughter up on a blog with wordpress.com the other day, and she wants to do a blog about pets and Harry Potter. So I set her up with this, right? </p><p>And I\'m going to start explaining all the good stuff with the blog editor. And here\'s what you do. You hit the plus button and she just looks at me and says, &#8220;Dad, you can go now.

There is a good chance that any developer who has looked up the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wpautop/\"><code>wpautop()</code> function</a> has stumbled upon it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading through the code can garner a chuckle from a few, but it is a momentary amusement. The problem has always been confusing variable names. In programming, clarity should be favored above all else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What is a <code>$pee</code>, exactly?</em> It is text. Therefore, <code>$text</code> makes sense as a variable name, which is one of recent code changes. Other modifications include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>$pee_parts</code> to <code>$text_parts</code></li><li><code>$last_pee</code> to <code>$last_part</code></li><li><code>$pees</code> to <code>$paragraphs</code></li><li><code>$tinkle</code> to <code>$paragraph</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That complex <code>wpautop()</code> function and its 150+ lines of code start making a bit more sense when things are named for clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the historical record: <code>$pee</code> was first seen in the WordPress codebase <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/13\">in 2003</a>. <code>$tinkle</code> did not make an appearance until <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/9255\">five years later</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer Rico Moorman asked for the problematic code to be changed in a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25615\">ticket in 2013</a>. There was some movement to replace the variable names at first. However, after several lead developers stepped in, the idea was shot down. The arguments against the change leaned on keeping the spirit of WordPress, its humor, and its history alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, 2022 is not 2013. The world has changed since the ticket was first opened. While it still has miles to go to be the all-inclusive community it can be, the WordPress space is seemingly more open to checking itself on language issues today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, when many in the worldwide developer community <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/github-to-use-main-instead-of-master-as-the-default-branch-on-all-new-repositories-starting-next-month\">switched their default Git repos</a> from &#8220;master&#8221; to &#8220;main,&#8221; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposal-to-rename-the-master-branch-from-wordpress-owned-git-repositories\">WordPress followed suit</a>. And, it managed to keep a bit of the charm of its SVN roots by using &#8220;trunk&#8221; instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, contributors <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/without-context-some-lyrics-inside-the-hello-dolly-plugin-are-degrading-to-women\">changed text in the Hello Dolly plugin</a> that was degrading to women, especially out of context. The plugin ships with WordPress and randomly displays a single line from Louis Armstrong&#8217;s &#8220;Hello, Dolly!&#8221; in the admin header. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two offending lines were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;Find her an empty lap, fellas&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Find her a vacant knee, fellas&#8221;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with some other trivial text changes, the former was removed altogether, and the latter was replaced with &#8220;Have a little faith in me, fellas.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world changes over time. Language evolves, and what may have been acceptable in years past will not always be so in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some lead developers may have been OK with the code in 2013. However, the community should never be afraid to reevaluate past stances once in a while. Maybe it was time to ditch the fine art of middle-school jokes in favor of clear and readable code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miriam Schwab renewed the discussion via the Post Status Slack chat in December 2021. The general sense from those in the conversation seemed to agree that it was not necessarily offensive but immature. Most of all, it did not have a place in modern WordPress. A team member of Schwab&#8217;s had found the code and also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25615#comment:22\">renewed the Trac ticket discussion</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this go-round, there was no pushback. It was simply time to say farewell to a part of the platform&#8217;s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this instance, WordPress has not lost any of its personality. Plus ,the variable changes will allow more developers to grasp what is happening in the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does mean that WordPress has a vacancy for at least one new joke or Easter egg. I am still a little salty about losing <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-personality-shines-through-again\">access to the Matrix</a>. But, it never hurts to mix it up once in a while. WordPress&#8217;s in-jokes should continue maturing along with the software.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Mar 2022 01:15:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Post Status: This Week at WordPress.org (February 28, 2022)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=94069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/this-week-at-wordpress-org-february-28-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5332:\"<p>Each week we are highlighting the news from WordPress.org that you don\'t want to miss.

He&#8217;s here to talk about WordPress notifications and how they are managed. If you&#8217;ve been using WordPress for any length of time, then you&#8217;ll have seen notifications appear in the admin area of your site. These messages can be useful. They might tell you something needs to be updated. Or that something was successfully saved. There&#8217;s also a chance that you&#8217;ve seen notifications for other purposes as well. Perhaps a plugin would like you to notice their upgrade offer, or that they have a sale on. All these notifications fall into the same place, and when multiple of them arise at the same time, the admin area can become cluttered and confusing, especially for novice users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that you don&#8217;t mind these notifications, but it seems that many people do, and feel that they&#8217;re being overused. They would prefer not to see so many notifications. And if notifications are to appear, that there are limitations on what they can show, and how large they can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, Jonathan talks about his concerns regarding WordPress notifications and the fact that there&#8217;s no system in place to limit what they can display, and for what purpose. He&#8217;s currently working on WP Notify, which is a project aiming to put a notifications area into your WordPress website. All notifications would appear in this area and there would be constraints about what you could and could not display there. It&#8217;s not about removing notifications completely, more about putting them in a defined place. Like you might find on your mobile phone. We talk about how notifications are currently created and how there are a few limits on what they can do. How over use of notifications can be a cause for concern, and how Jonathan&#8217;s solution aims to add a unified system to WordPress, which would put the user in control of the notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes over at WP Tavern dot com forward slash podcast, and look for episode number 16. And so without further delay, I bring you Jonathan Bossenger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Jonathan Bassinger. Hello Jonathan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Hello, Nathan, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m very well. Jonathan is joining us today to talk about WordPress notifications. Now I could introduce this subject and say all sorts of things off the bat. My thoughts on things, but it would probably muddy the water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Jonathan, it&#8217;s over to you. Tell us about WordPress notifications and the issues that you see, and then we&#8217;ll get into the weeds and discuss the finer points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Sure. No problem. So, before I start, I&#8217;d like to mention that my problems with WordPress notifications come from both the point of view of a contributor to WordPress, and also a person who makes money off WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So some of the first products that I created for WordPress were plugins and part of those plugins required me to give some kind of feedback to the user if they had saved settings, or if there was some change that they had to make or whatever the case may be. And then from there I moved on to building plugins for clients or doing custom work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point that I noticed that there was a problem as it were with notifications was when I used to log into client&#8217;s websites, as a new administrator and I was flooded with, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all seen the screenshots of this on social media, but flooded with notifications from this plugin that has just been updated to, this plugin has an upgrade, a paid upgrade to this plugin is just on this over here. This theme has got this, that, and the next thing. And I&#8217;m reading half a page, sometimes a full page, of notifications before I can even start working with the dashboard. The, in big inverted air-quotes, problem with notifications is the fact that there is no official centralized way to register and present notifications to the user other than using admin notices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re a developer of a plugin or developer of a theme, there is the admin notices hook that you can hook into, but you can pretty much hook any HTML into that hook. So the documentation gives you some guidelines as to status classes that you can use for your div to display it in red or green as a success or an error, but you have full leeway to build anything you want there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you could build a full page notification. You could build a tiny notification. They are guidelines in the plugin and theme handbooks that gives you guidelines of what you should do and what you should stick to. But there&#8217;s nothing to force you down that path. And with notifications. These admin notices traditionally should be being used to give the user feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve created a post, I hit save, and I need to see a message that says, yay, my post has been saved. This admin notices functionality is now being, and I don&#8217;t want to use the word abused, so I&#8217;m not going to, but overused by folks who are trying to give the user some other form of notification, some other piece of messaging, some other piece of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the problem is a historical one in that WordPress core has the capacity to pop-up things, which presumably the intention was that anybody who wished to use these would have something legitimate to say. As you say, post has been saved, something has been deleted and so on, and there are no constraints around really what you can put in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be enormous. It could be very wordy. It could contain images, animated gifts, and so on. And there&#8217;s no real constraints about the way that it can be implemented. And I think for the most experienced users of WordPress, that is to say somebody that&#8217;s dabbling in there everyday, you kind of become a little bit numb to it and you just log into WordPress and immediately dismiss them all, click whatever option is available to make them go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there they were and clients, people less experienced, I think the problem might reside in the fact that they might cause some sort of alarm, you know, it might be, oh, well, why is that appearing? There&#8217;s probably some kind of upgrade that I should have had. Why haven&#8217;t I got the upgrade and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a historical problem. Do you know, roughly speaking, how far do we need to rewind the clock before the, in inverted commas, over use of these began. When was the first time you saw this being used for ulterior motives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:23] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So it&#8217;s difficult for me to say that 100%, because I&#8217;ve only been very active in the WordPress space since around 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use WordPress as a blogging platform from about 2009, but that&#8217;s, as far as it went, I had a blog. I had maybe a security plugin installed, maybe a forms plugin, but I was just using it for blogging purposes. So it was only in 2015, 2016 that I started building for WordPress that I started seeing, personally seeing these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say that since it&#8217;s definitely gotten worse. There was a stage in about 2017, 2018 that I started seeing it more and more and more. The thing that you mentioned earlier about, you know, as an experienced user of WordPress, we see these notifications. We know how to dismiss them. We know how to click. The concern that I always have is never mind somebody who&#8217;s a client, nevermind somebody who is a business owner. Let&#8217;s just look at somebody who wants to blog with WordPress or build themselves as simple website with WordPress. What is the user story gonna look like? They&#8217;re going to either through their hosting company, they&#8217;re going to install WordPress through some kind of one-click install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe they&#8217;re using a managed hosting environment, which does it all for you. Maybe they&#8217;re technically savvy enough to download the zip file and upload it to a server. They&#8217;re going to install it. They&#8217;re going to start using it. They&#8217;re going to need to have, maybe a contact form. They&#8217;re going to need to maybe have some kind of plug-in functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re going to start looking for plugins to install things. Then as you say, suddenly, they&#8217;re going to see these messages and these messages are going to be jumping out at them. And these messages are different sizes and different shapes, and it just creates this very jagged, jarring experience for the new user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we can&#8217;t blame WordPress because WordPress Core itself is using admin notices correctly. We can&#8217;t really blame plugin developers and theme developers because, they&#8217;re trying to get this information to the user, with a system that&#8217;s not designed for it. So the problem is not one single entity&#8217;s problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is all of our problems. That&#8217;s the kind of the way I look at it. We all need to work together with WordPress Core, with plugin developers, with team developers and find a better way to register these, non, I don&#8217;t like to call them notifications because to me a notification is&#8230; your post has been saved successfully, or you have created a new post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s call them announcements just for the sake of this podcast. We need to find a way to register these announcements that are outside of the scope of the day-to-day use of WordPress and present them to the user in a way that is clean and nice, and doesn&#8217;t, doesn&#8217;t disturb them using WordPress on a day to day, but is accessible and they can, and they can see the information that they see in a, in a way that is formalised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you think then the notifications that we have at the moment, which can consume any HTML, let&#8217;s imagine that nothing additional were to be added into WordPress, and we&#8217;ll get on to your project a little bit later, but if we were simply to have it that just text could go in there and that text could be limited, say to a certain string length, I don&#8217;t know, 30 characters or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would that potentially solve the problem in your eyes? Or are there situations where anyone may need more than that, because obviously if we just limited it to text, we could still put all sorts of interesting and perhaps unwanted messages in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:58] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So I speak to you now as a developer. And let me tell you that if you put some kind of limitation down, some clever developer will come along and figure out how to work around this. As it is, you know, the admin, the admin notice the system as it is, is kind of restrictive, but the only way that you could physically restrict it, is if you, every time a new plugin submission comes in, you had somebody physically inspecting every single instance of the notification system and making sure that this person was following the guidelines. And I&#8217;m sure we all remember a number of years ago that the theme team was kind of coming under fire because they were taking a long time to review themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was because everything was still being done manually. The plugging team is a small number of people due to the security that&#8217;s involved in getting plugin submitted and what plugins have to deal with. So expecting a team of people to physically inspect every single admin notice that comes through. I mean, sure, you could probably automate it in some way, but we all know that developers are crafty. We all know that developers, I mean, that&#8217;s part of what being developed is, finding ways to solve difficult problems. So you put a constraint down in front of a developer on an open source project, you know, code that is publicly available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And say, right, we&#8217;re now stopping you from doing X. They&#8217;re going to find a way. So to me it&#8217;s a little bit less of the stick and more of the carrot. We need to provide a way that gives developers the ability specifically, and I speak now as somebody who failed dismally to try and start a plugin business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one of the biggest things that I struggled with was marketing. How do I market my paid products off of my free ones? You know, WordPress dot org plugin repository and the theme repository is, we all know this, is one of the top places to get yourself known, put out a free product, get customers into the funnel, but then how do you turn them into paying customers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know we have a problem with sponsorship of open source products. It&#8217;s spoken about all the time. How do we, how do we balance the needs of the open source project and the people that are building plugins for it and how do we balance the need for them to market to their customers, to, to bring, you know, free customers into the paying funnel, in a way that isn&#8217;t disruptive to regular users of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in my opinion, the only way that we can do that is by creating something that is well-defined in terms of, this is how you do things, this is how you register things. But it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not being thrown into the user&#8217;s face when they want to see that information. To me, that&#8217;s the only way that, that we do it in</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of describing problematic notifications or announcements or whatever term we&#8217;d like to use. There must be a point where in your own mind it strays from being, well, that&#8217;s totally acceptable. Everybody ought to be seeing that. And then there&#8217;s some kind of gray area, no man&#8217;s land where that feels a bit shady, I&#8217;m not quite sure what to make of that. And then presumably there are examples which you could mention where it&#8217;s clearly something that you would strongly urge people not to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to just describe examples of maybe things which you think are totally legitimate and then also some examples, we should probably not use any names, examples where you&#8217;ve seen things that you think actually, I think that you&#8217;re pushing a little bit too hard then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Sure. I can definitely give some examples. I won&#8217;t give names because that&#8217;s just not something I want to start doing right now, but I can give you some personal examples of notifications that I&#8217;ve dealt with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I used to be a developer for a company called Castos. We managed a podcasting plugin for WordPress. And at that stage, I was very focused on making sure that our notifications were not disruptive to our users or any other user of the WordPress site that happened to have the plugin installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as an example, our one, let&#8217;s call it onboarding form to try and get customers to sign up for our podcast hosting service, was only available on the plugin settings page. So only when you went to the plugin settings on the right-hand side, there was a nice little sidebar with a little graphic to say, hey, if you&#8217;re enjoying the plugin, but you&#8217;re looking for a way to host your files, here&#8217;s a form you can fill in. We&#8217;ll give you a 10% discount to try it out. To me, that&#8217;s not disruptive, because the user can still use their settings. They can still make changes. They&#8217;re not seeing this notification at the top of the screen in their face every time, it&#8217;s off to the right. It&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s visible, but it&#8217;s not disruptive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing we were very focused on is when we do update messages. So when the plugin gets updated, if there&#8217;s some kind of process that needs to be run, maybe there&#8217;s a database upgrade that needs to be run. That to me makes sense as a, let&#8217;s call it a site-wide notice, or a more general admin notice, but we kept them very limited. Maybe one sentence. We didn&#8217;t use the red color or the green color, we just kept it gray and just said, hey, we noticed you&#8217;ve recently updated. Here&#8217;s a link to click through to make the changes. But specific things related to the plugin. So if we would, I can actually give you a perfect example. There were some changes in the Apple podcast categories and Apple podcasting was changing how the categories worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what we did was, if you loaded up the plugin and you updated the plugin, you saw no messages, you saw no notifications, you could carry on doing your things, because it would all just work. When you went to the page that allows you to control your categories, there we showed you a specific message to say, by the way, did you know Apple have recently updated their categories, your old categories are still going to work, but it would be a good idea to change your categories on this page. And then as soon as the person saved that page, that notification goes away. So to me, that&#8217;s an example of how, as a developer, you can sort of think of, you know, how do I get free users onto the paid version?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, how do I display relevant information to the user? Some of the bad things that I&#8217;ve seen, there are a couple of popular page builders that I won&#8217;t name. I think I might&#8217;ve tweeted about it. So maybe if you go back in my feed, you might find. With the Block Editor coming out. When you load up a new post, you have this option to select, and the only reason I know this is because for various reasons, I have both of these page builders on my site because I&#8217;ve done some demo content with them for tutorials in the past. When I create a new post, I get this big, these two big buttons saying, do you want to use this page builder? Do you want to use that page builder? Or do you want to use the default page builder. When I select, and this might&#8217;ve changed, cause it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve done this, but when I select default page builder, at the very top of the Block Editor, there are now these two big buttons, saying switch back to the other page builders, switch back to the second page builder that you have installed. To me, that&#8217;s kind of pushing it, because I&#8217;ve already chosen that I want to use the default editor. Now to keep bugging me. And the other thing that I hated about those buttons were, they both had their own colour schemes. So they were very jarring in the block editor. Cause I keep my WordPress on a very clean theme. So now I&#8217;ve got these big, bold colors at the top of my editing area. And they were both using separate fonts as well. They weren&#8217;t using standard WordPress dashboard fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to me, that was very much in my face and almost getting to a point where I wanted to stop using their products because they were being so vibrant about that. There was another example recently where somebody had, I can&#8217;t remember the details but, I think it was, I think it was The Tavern site, where somebody had added, I think it was a signup or an upgrade or something button as a HTML field in the settings sidebar, which there was quite a bit of conversation around. To me again, that&#8217;s the problem, you know, where you are using space that should be used for one purpose, you know, control or settings or whatever. And now you&#8217;re taking over that space to put in your notifications or your upgrades or upsells. Those to me are the kind of the problematic areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds to me as if you&#8217;re demarcating in your own head at least, the pages, the places on a website which have legitimate use. So the general admin, if you just click the dashboard link and you&#8217;re into WordPress and you&#8217;re not in any particular setting for any particular plugin. You feel that those ought to be limited to possibly text and just very informational in nature and something which is more or less critical, something which you must take care of because otherwise. Right. Okay. So that&#8217;s what belongs there. But if you were to go into the settings page of any particular plugin, that&#8217;s more of a free for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you feel that there&#8217;s any constraints there or are you, you mentioned that for Castos, you have a sidebar. I remember seeing that have actually used that before. And there it was, and it did genuinely feel as if that was the right place for it, because I was already in the settings. I was thinking that I was going to be interacting in some way with Castos, and so the upgrade felt like an appropriate place. Any limitations on that? Are we allowed to go full page in there or should there be some constraints around that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:03] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Well, for me, it&#8217;s always about the user experience. So, I feel like a lot of developers, they understand the the balance between creating a good user experience and interacting with your users. The company that I work for now, Delicious Brains, it was about a year ago now released version two of WP Migrate DB Pro with a new user interface, and the notifications that come up when you log into the plugin page and the plugin settings, they&#8217;re just so nice and clean and they don&#8217;t overwhelm you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are useful information, you know. Even if you install the free plugin, there&#8217;s a little bit of a thing at the top, but it doesn&#8217;t bombard you. So in my opinion, yes, if you&#8217;re building a product for WordPress today, and you are forced to use admin notices. You should think about how you&#8217;re registering these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the, one of the things that I spent the most time on when we were releasing updates to the plugin at Castos was triggering certain notifications only at certain points. So, when there was an upgrade from 1.2 to 1.3, then trigger a certain notification. But then when the user dismisses that notification save the fact that they&#8217;ve dismissed it and don&#8217;t show it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we actually spent time thinking about this, because there&#8217;s nothing worse and this actually happened. So the reason we spend the time is because something happened. We launched an update, it included an upgrade step that the user had to action. But we didn&#8217;t have any kind of check in place. So every single time a new user installed the plugin, they got this upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that&#8217;s fine in the scope of one plugin. Think about let&#8217;s say 15 popular plugins do that. Your user comes along and likes those plugins and installs those plugins and suddenly has 15 notifications in their main dashboard they have to deal with. If those were separated, off and in the settings for each plugin, then it would limit that amount of overwhelm. And they would only see that notification when they&#8217;re dealing with those settings. So I do believe that putting plugins specific notifications in certain places is a better way. The problem you have with that though, is that the other reason developers use notifications is to push users into that funnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I am not standing here today saying we shouldn&#8217;t allow developers to do that. I strongly support people who are working on open source products, being able to be given the ability to earn income, to be able to be given the ability to turn non-paying customers, into paying customers. But we need to do it in such a way that it doesn&#8217;t overwhelm the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t frustrate them. We should be making it a, we should be making the process of signing up for our product as fun and pleasant as it is using WordPress. And if we are bombarding our customers with notifications from day one when, and that&#8217;s why I say we, we have to find a better way to do this. We can take what we currently have and try and patch it up because what we currently have has been overused for so long and is already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s the word I want to use? I don&#8217;t want to use broken because it means that it was working before, but it&#8217;s been again, I don&#8217;t want to say misused because that sounds so negative. Used incorrectly, used for the wrong reasons, because the reasons that exist, the reasons that exist today, for people to use these notifications are ten times more, what they were, you know, five, ten years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Some of the examples that I&#8217;m going to give here come into my head when I&#8217;m thinking about advertising and overwhelm of advertising and misuse. And so a good example would be, if you go to a news site, I can think of an example of a local news site to me. And I go there and I find it incredibly difficult to use that website because they&#8217;ve taken the path of advertising and there are adverts, splattered everywhere so much so that it&#8217;s almost impossible to find the actual content. The content is split up into small paragraphs and they are punctuated by advertisements. And I feel that&#8217;s probably the argument that you&#8217;re making is that if we clutter the UI, if we allow the UI to be cluttered by things which people didn&#8217;t necessarily wish or need to see, then we are making the experience poorer. And I go to that website. I find it quite difficult to stay there. It may be that I need the content so badly that I&#8217;ll persevere, but I&#8217;ve got this instinctive reaction to get away. And we don&#8217;t wish people to enter WordPress, have an initial experience which is poor and continually frustrated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, on the flip side, there&#8217;s obviously some sort of commercial need, as you&#8217;ve described. People would wish to turn their free projects into paid projects and have some subscribers. And I guess plugin developers would point to the fact that in a normal situation, you would get a product and probably give up your email address in return for that. But on the WordPress side, if they come to the repo and download your free plugin, you have no access to that. You haven&#8217;t managed to get them into a funnel in any way, shape or form. They&#8217;re just consuming your product, and that&#8217;s the end of the road. They may use it forever, and I have no idea who you are or any other product that you may offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in fact, they may well miss out on something which they genuinely, legitimately needed. And so the developers would argue, I guess, that we need some way to do this. We&#8217;re going to try to keep it under control, but I suppose the problem is human nature. Is that given the fact that the area is open to any HTML as you described, it just starts to get overused. The boundaries get pushed, things that were acceptable yesterday are going to be pushed further. And then what&#8217;s acceptable in a year&#8217;s time may get pushed further. And your position, I suppose, is we just want to reign this in a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing which comes to mind is commercial television. On the TV side of things, probably radio as well, we&#8217;ve gotten quite used to the fact that our content will be punctuated with adverts. We&#8217;ve walked across the mental bridge that, I cannot watch this program unless it is paid for by advertising. So every 15 minutes or so I will cope. I&#8217;ll sit there and I&#8217;ll consume the adverts or I&#8217;ll go and make a cup of coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess making coffee is the equivalent of dismissing something in WordPress, but that&#8217;s just part of life. So I do wonder where most people will sit on this. They realize that there&#8217;s a commercial need for these things to exist. And so they cope with it, but it may not be ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:37] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> And that&#8217;s one of the reasons why we need something new because I am, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not saying that we should punish all plugin developers because they want to make a living.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not just saying that. As I said earlier, I failed at building a plugin business because I didn&#8217;t know how to market myself properly. I didn&#8217;t know how to turn plugins that I built for free into a paid product and how to convert customers. And I kind of think there are others that have done it successfully and there are those that haven&#8217;t. So I&#8217;m here just saying, you know, developers shouldn&#8217;t be paid for their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I a hundred percent agree that they should be paid for their work. And I don&#8217;t believe, as I said, I don&#8217;t believe the problem is the plugin developers. Because if you think about it, let&#8217;s go back to the example I had of, you know, Seriously Simple Podcasting. We release an update, so we show that update to the user on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m testing that, I&#8217;m just seeing that one notification, but when the user has it on their website, they&#8217;re seeing that notification plus however many other useful, important notifications are being pushed out by other plugins. You might be in a situation, and I have seen this before, where you&#8217;ve got an admin dashboard with ten important notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there&#8217;s been a WordPress update. So that means what plugin X had to make a change in how they do something, so you need to run an upgrade. Plugin Y made an upgrade change to their tables, so you need to run that. This plugin did this. And those are all legitimate notifications. Now, first of all, the user doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s more important and what is primary? You know, they&#8217;re all just the same color. They&#8217;re all just red. So it&#8217;s all just a stress factor. So number one, how do we give plugin developers the option to say, hey, this is a minor update, so you should do this, but not the end of the world. Like with the categories, the example I gave earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we give another plugin developer the option to say, this is rather important. If you don&#8217;t do this, something could go wrong with your site. Then how do we say, okay, this is a really low end thing. This is just, you know, okay, the plugin&#8217;s been updated and make a note of this change and you can read it later if you want to. We have no way of doing that right now. We have no way of giving plugin developers, theme developers, an option to create a status level and have a certain type of message that the user can go through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we live in a world where our mobile phones have amazing notification systems. And I can control what notifications I want to read. So I have a Facebook account purely to interact with the folks on some of the WordPress groups that I&#8217;m in. But I switched those notifications off, because none of those notifications are primarily important to me. But I certainly switched the notifications to the messaging app that I have with my wife, because those notifications that are important to me. I allow my banking notifications to come through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If my banking app sends me advertising, I&#8217;m okay with that because I accept the fact that they&#8217;re a business. They need to make money. I&#8217;m already giving them some of my money every month with banking fees and all of that, but they want to make more, fine, I accept that. Because the benefits of receiving the SMS to tell me that my credit card has been cloned, do I want to cancel it, overrides my distaste by advertising, but that, that exists as a concept. WordPress doesn&#8217;t have that place where I, as a user can choose, even simply which notifications I want to see and which I don&#8217;t. So if I say I&#8217;m using SEO plugin X, whatever the name is, and I want to see the notifications because my SEO is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I will probably accept any upsells or upgrade notifications and I will either read them or just mark them as read, but I will be happy to receive them because the rest of the information they&#8217;re giving me to keep my SEO on board to make sure my meta tags are right, is my featured image working, is my social media image working? All those things that are important to me, I will accept their messaging. And I believe that in doing something like that, where there is a specific, formalized way of doing things. If I see SEO plugin X is using that system, giving me the user the control to receive the messaging, and SEO plug in Z is not, I personally will have more of a inkling to use X, because X is putting the control of notifications back in my hands, which I respect and anybody who&#8217;s bombarding me, I&#8217;ll have less of an inkling to want to use their product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think the mobile phone example is really excellent because we can probably all identify with that. There&#8217;s usually some kind of drop down notification held and little icons appear to alert you to the fact that there&#8217;s something there to read, if you wish. And then of course you scroll down and you can very quickly dismiss them. But then they are, there in a confined area. And that area is familiar to you as the place where notifications are. It can be totally ignored. You could come back to it in five days time, safe in the knowledge that they will be there still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And were are they important? Well, that&#8217;s on you, you knew they were there and you decided to ignore them. And then further to that, I&#8217;ve seen a trend recently within mobile phone apps to have notification settings within the apps. So you can go in and say to the banking app, look, I&#8217;m very happy to receive the critical updates about security breaches, but I&#8217;d probably rather not have the, I don&#8217;t know, here&#8217;s our latest mortgage deal kind of notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The premise there must be that the banking app realizes that there is some balance of trust to be gained. And if you keep pushing the relevant to some, but irrelevant to most, notifications out at some point, the trust scale tips, and you become tired of this app and you may uninstall it. Now, in the case of banking, it maybe that&#8217;s a step too far, you&#8217;te kind of wedded to that, but you can imagine something where there are three or four rivals and you&#8217;re trying to weigh up, which one&#8217;s better for you. The overwhelm of notifications may just be the thing that tips you against it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s move into the project that you&#8217;ve got, WP Notify, because that feels to me as if you&#8217;re trying to replicate the mobile phone model. In other words, everything is tucked away in a particular area. Do you want to describe this enterprise just in broad brush strokes, and then we&#8217;ll talk about specifically what it does, and also how you may get involved in where the project&#8217;s at right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:00] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Sure. So, the goal of WP Notify, as we originally defined in the initial post. And before I get into that, I just want to give a shout out to, sorry dude, I can&#8217;t pronounce your surname, but he was the guy who came up with a proposal originally. He tweeted that he didn&#8217;t have time to try and move it forward. So I contacted him and I picked it up from there. But his original proposal was very simply, we need a better notification system for WordPress. We can&#8217;t take what we currently have, which has been overused, which is limited, and it&#8217;s limited in its technology, but unlimited in what people can do with it, and that&#8217;s the problem. We can&#8217;t take that and make that better. We need something brand new. And then once we have something brand new, that works, that makes sense that balances the needs of the user and the open source project. And the developers who are trying to earn money from their project. Once we have something like that, then it&#8217;s easier to control, to tame these notifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it&#8217;s easier to put guidelines in place. And then when the developers build their plugins, they are almost forced because when they register a notice, they can only register three fields. Those are the only three fields that are allowed. They can put whatever texts they wanted them, but those are the three fields. They can&#8217;t go overboard. They can&#8217;t make it bigger. They have a specific format, and the way they look. They&#8217;re allowed to add certain things, but not other things. That&#8217;s just where we&#8217;re at. So that&#8217;s what an WP Notify is. It&#8217;s a project that we kicked off now in 2019. So it&#8217;ll be going on for three years in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an open source, what&#8217;s known as a feature plugin. So a feature plugin is something that is, I want to say, not sponsored by, has been accepted by WordPress Core in general as a good idea. We have an official GitHub repository on the WordPress organization and we have a Slack channel, and we are slowly trying to build this better notification system for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So imagine that I&#8217;ve enabled this, I&#8217;ve downloaded it and activated it. I will, by the way, link to the GitHub repository and various other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:07] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> I wouldn&#8217;t install and activate it just yet, because it&#8217;s not something that you can actually use yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So rewind. I haven&#8217;t installed it. I haven&#8217;t activated it. None of that stuff has happened. What does it look like? What will it present me with? As a user if I&#8217;m looking at the screen, what will I be seeing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:24] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Okay. So it&#8217;s difficult to obviously, you know, describe this in a podcast environment, but the idea is very similar to what we were chatting about when we spoke about the Android or the iOS, the mobile phone notification system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to have some kind of icon, not a jumping blinging one, but some kind of icon, be it a bell or something. I think in the design that is. That shows some kind of user interface messaging to say, you have new notifications. The user is then able to click on that. They&#8217;re able to see the notifications come up, they&#8217;re able to scan through, see which ones are important to them, see which ones aren&#8217;t. Read the ones that are dismissed, the ones that aren&#8217;t. The other idea as we spoke about earlier is to give the user the control over who they want to receive notifications from. So if they keep getting a bunch of notifications from plugin X that are never useful to them, they can turn it off if they want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they receive notifications from plugin X that are useful for them, they leave them on. It is up to the user to then choose to either read or dismiss those notifications. We don&#8217;t want to go as far as saying, we&#8217;re only going to show notifications that are state changes or update changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want the plugin developers to be able to advertise their products. We want the theme developers and the product developers to be able to say, hey, we&#8217;ve got a black Friday special on. We&#8217;ve got a discount code running, whatever. We want those things, but we want them in a way that the user has the control. So there are some designs, as you can see, if you go through to the GitHub repository on the read me page, we have links to our design documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have links to our requirements documents. We spent about, due to the nature of open source, we spent probably about a year and a half just working on what are the requirements version one? And that went through a lot of process of feedback and revisions. Then we worked on design and that went through feedback and revisions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we&#8217;re starting at the sort of initial implementation phase and our first goal, our first short term goal right now is to take those designs, and actually implement them purely as HTML so that you, Nathan, or anybody else who is interested, could install the plugin and just see what we&#8217;re planning. Just to get a visual idea of what this could look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal after that is to then get feedback from the community. From the plugin developers, from the theme developers, from the users, from the open source community. And say, does this solve the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve? If it does, then we can start looking at how do we implement this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How has the project been received? Have you had a lot of engagement? Has it been a difficult struggle trying to get people involved? What&#8217;s your opinion on where you&#8217;re at given the time that&#8217;s been spent on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:55] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> That&#8217;s so here&#8217;s where we get into a little bit of personal history on this. For me, it&#8217;s been a little bit difficult because I&#8217;m not a fully sponsored contributor to opensource. I have a day job. And my day job requires me to do certain things for the business that I work for, be it, when I started it was Castos, now it&#8217;s Delicious Brains. I am allowed X amount of time to contribute to open source, but it&#8217;s not, I&#8217;m not allowed to spend my whole day. So I&#8217;ve kind of worked in a bit of a, it&#8217;s called a project manager slash wrangler role, just to try and get people interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had, when we launched, we had, if you go to the initial launch post, we had loads and loads of comments and everybody was keen and everybody was excited. The problem was, in my opinion at least, everybody had their own idea of how this should work. And there was actually a stage, and if you go back into the history of the meetings, there was a stage where there was a bit of a of almost people fighting with each other in the meetings. Because one was saying it should be done this way, and one was saying it should be done then the other way. And we hadn&#8217;t even, we hadn&#8217;t even done requirements gathering yet, but people were already deciding how to build this thing. But we didn&#8217;t even know what we were building yet. So that kind of tapered off, and then we got a nice core group of folks. There was maybe ten of us. I can&#8217;t remember the exact numbers, but around ten of us that were meeting regularly. We were doing the requirements gathering. And I want to shout out to a bunch of people here Mervin, Hernandez, Ari. I can&#8217;t pronounce his surname, but he works at Yoast now, he was the theme team representative. Aaron from who was at Auttomatic, she&#8217;s somewhere else. A couple of other folks that I&#8217;m forgetting right now. I apologize in advance, but they were really involved and keeping things going. There was another chap who I know he&#8217;s a WordPress user name, but I don&#8217;t know his first name. His represented prestigious as Ramen. I don&#8217;t remember his first name. He was very influential in getting the PHP side going. And what&#8217;s happened now is we&#8217;ve kind of reached this point where COVID happened, and people&#8217;s lives changed. And I noticed that things started going down a bit and we just kind of kept chugging along and chugging along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I&#8217;m now seeing is that with all of this conversation, that&#8217;s going on, people are coming back into the project. So we had a bit of work done last year on getting that HTML going, which I mentioned earlier. That kind of died down. And then recently somebody joined again and said, hey, I want to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the biggest problem that we have as an open source feature plugin, if you will, is just getting the, and it&#8217;s difficult in an source environment because you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t have a lot of easy ways to connect the folks. You have to make blog where you can create posts and I&#8217;ll blame myself here. I probably wasn&#8217;t keeping up the post as much as I should have. But you don&#8217;t really have like an official way to, you know, call to arms and get people involved. So whenever I do see these posts that jump up and down about notifications are a problem, then part of me goes, well, we&#8217;re here, we&#8217;re over here, come and have a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have had some people coming in, now, it looks like we&#8217;re moving forward again with HTML side of things. So I&#8217;m hoping that very soon we&#8217;ll be able to actually release this installable plugin that doesn&#8217;t do much, but actually just looks like what it&#8217;s going to look like. And I&#8217;m hoping my, my hope is that when we can do that, when we can physically give people something to install, and see, then they will get excited and start getting involved again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If I were an end user of WordPress and I had things tucked away in a notification panel or whatever that might be, that feels to me like, well, a good repository for notifications. I&#8217;m just wondering from the plugin developer side, especially from the perspective of somebody who is, really, as clean as a whistle. They never misstep and misuse notifications. They just keep everything very slim and very lean and they don&#8217;t bother us too much. What would the future for them look like? Are they going to be additional hurdles that they would have to jump through? Let&#8217;s imagine a scenario in two or three years time. WP Notify has become part of Core and everybody needs to go through the process of registering their notifications in the correct way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would the burden be like? Is it very minimal on the plugin developer side? How does that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:57] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So I&#8217;ll say this, I don&#8217;t see admin notices going anywhere anytime soon. And one of the reasons for that is because WordPress Core uses it extensively and will probably continue to do so until we move completely towards a JavaScript admin dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t see admin notices going anywhere anytime soon. So those developers that are using admin notices in big air quotes correctly, won&#8217;t be affected. Those that are using them in different places, but unobtrusively currently it&#8217;s a case of, you register a hook. Your write a little bit of HTML, and your notice works. On the WP Notify side, we want to make it as easy as that as well. So they will be a defined structure. You can actually see, I can send you a link. There&#8217;s a document where we have the defined structure of a notification. And if I remember correctly, it&#8217;s title and description. So very similar to what an admin notice currently looks like. An admin notice just has a description area, if you will. It doesn&#8217;t even, it&#8217;s not even defined, it generally gets used as a description area. We&#8217;ve added a title. And then I seem to recall, can&#8217;t remember hundred percent, I&#8217;ll have to double check, but I think we&#8217;ve also added a possibility to register a URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if the user needs to click on a link to go and trigger some other action or click on a link internally in WordPress to trigger some action. So as a developer, you would have a similar rich user interface where currently you would hook into an admin notice. You would register a callback. Your call back would continue HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WP Notify you would have a similar hook and then you would register an object, and the object has your title, your description, and if you wanted your URL. So we want to keep it as easy to use as what admin notices is, but as friendly to the user as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think probably Jonathan I&#8217;ve asked everything that I wish to ask. The inevitable thing is, is there anything that you wished to describe that I didn&#8217;t ask you about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:43] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> No. At the end of the day, The only thing that the only thing that I&#8217;m, let&#8217;s call it keen on, if you want a better word is to move this forward. So right now I&#8217;m going to use this opportunity to say if there are any front end developers or any developers out there who are very good at turning design into HTML. You want to find some way to contribute to WordPress, we have an open track ticket, where some work has been done. If we can get that over the line, that will make a huge. Then, if there are any developers who want to make this happen and they&#8217;re very good on the PHP side, or they&#8217;re very good on the JavaScript side, please come along and take a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is linked through on our GitHub Wiki. We have a project Wiki dedicated towards the requirements documents, the design, the requirements analysis we did, the open issues and the pull request. It&#8217;s all there. So come along and come and join us, come and help us build a better notification system for WordPress, because once we can put that in place, then we can make amazing things happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Jonathan, if somebody were interested in reaching out to you personally, because they would like to contribute in some way or just find out more. Do you have any links or websites or social channels that you frequent?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:54] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Sure. I am on Twitter. It&#8217;s John underscore Bossenger because Jonathan Bossenger was too long for Twitter, back in the day. You&#8217;re also welcome to email me. My email address is my full name. Jonathan Bossenger at gmail dot com. I don&#8217;t mind sharing that email address because Gmail&#8217;s pretty good at handling spam. And I would just say that if you do email me to ask me questions, please give me some time because I am very strict with how I manage my emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll check that mailbox once a day and reply when necessary. Finally, if you want to get involved, go to github dot com slash wordpress slash wp hyphen notify and go through from there. If you are already contributing to WordPress and you&#8217;re already in the WordPress Slack, there is a feature notifications channel where we have our meetings every Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s 2:00 PM UTC, please feel free to come and join. And you&#8217;re welcome to DM me in that Slack. Email is the best. I&#8217;m a little bit old now, so this whole Twitter DM thing is something I still struggle with. So, if you want to ask me questions, email is . Probably the best. Otherwise get me onto Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Jonathsn Bossenger, thanks for joining us today on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:52] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> No problem.

After being <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\">punted from the WordPress 5.9 release</a>, it was moved to the Gutenberg project, where it could be built alongside related features that relied on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The API has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37140\">merged into the Gutenberg plugin</a> and should land in version 12.8. Theme authors who want to test it can clone the dev version of the plugin or <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/#nightly\">download the nightly version</a> from Gutenberg Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jono Alderson opened the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46370\">original ticket</a> for a web fonts API in February 2019. However, it was not until late 2021 that it gained a mass of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-web-font-api-possibly-coming-to-wordpress\">support and development</a>. By most accounts, the API looked ready to ship with WordPress 5.9. However, it was put on hold by Andrew Ozz, one of the lead WordPress developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not a popular decision, but it may have been the best direction. The API was limited because it did not yet have <code>theme.json</code> support. Being only available through PHP meant that theme authors would have mostly been doing what they always have &#8212; rolling out their own solution. This was not the holdup for its unveiling, but it will likely be the API&#8217;s most common use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many wanted to see this feature land in WordPress 5.9, the extra months have given it time to evolve into a cleaner API that integrates with the site and content editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can now define font-face definitions alongside their corresponding families in <code>theme.json</code> files, and WordPress will automatically load the necessary <code>@font-face</code> CSS in the editor and on the front-end. I have tested this extensively and have not run into any problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential downside is that the feature only ships with support for a local provider, which means fonts must be bundled with the theme. A Google Fonts provider was part of the original implementation but was later removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozz goes into <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36394#issuecomment-981970167\">further details in an earlier ticket</a>, but his recommendation was to drop Google Fonts support for now:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Add support only for local fonts for now. If WordPress decides to include support for the Google CDN later on, the implementation will have to consider web privacy laws and restrictions and be tied with an eventual User Consent API, etc.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-neutral-900-color has-neutral-100-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Related article:</strong> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/german-court-fines-website-owner-for-violating-the-gdpr-by-using-google-hosted-fonts\">German Court Fines Website Owner for Violating the GDPR by Using Google-Hosted Fonts</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ari Stathopoulos, one of the developers behind the web fonts API, explained that bundling a solution in core that writes the font files directly to the server <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36394#issuecomment-986541963\">would improve privacy</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Instead of removing it, maybe we could implement them properly, enforcing locally-hosted webfonts to improve performance &amp; privacy? This way we&#8217;d be setting a good example, and we&#8217;d see a significant performance &amp; privacy improvement in the WP ecosystem as themes &amp; plugins that currently use Google-fonts, Adobe-fonts and whatnot will start to adopt the API.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, it looks like local fonts are officially supported, but theme and plugin authors must register custom providers. One fear with leaving out Google Fonts support is that there will be many competing solutions in the wild instead of one solid provider that everyone can rely on. The more developers build their own wheels, the more likely different implementations ship with bugs or security issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic already has a <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/23045\">draft patch for a Google provider</a> for Jetpack. Assuming that gets pulled into the plugin, it will undoubtedly conflict with a theme down the road that registers its own <code>google</code> provider ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only supporting local fonts could also create larger theme download sizes. For many themes, this should be a non-issue. One, two, or three font packages are reasonable. However, if global style variations become popular, we could see themes that ship dozens of fonts to cover multiple pre-packaged designs. That will quickly lead to bloated theme files and, combined with enough images, theme authors may hit the 10MB limit for submission to the directory. That feels a little like tomorrow&#8217;s problem, but it is something to begin thinking about today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still some issues that need to be solved around the API. However, pushing it through this early in the WordPress 6.0 release cycle will give everyone time to test and help improve it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"testing-bundled-fonts\">Testing Bundled Fonts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two methods for registering web fonts with WordPress. For theme authors, the simplest solution is to define them via their <code>theme.json</code> files. This is the method that I will cover below since the file has been standard since WordPress 5.8. There is a PHP example in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37140\">pull request ticket</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>theme.json</code> keys and values mostly correspond to the CSS <code>@font-face</code> rule.
